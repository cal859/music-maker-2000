<SONGSTART>Damn, already 3 in the mornin'
It's going down, leanin', drink your drink
Candy sweets, know what I'm saying.
Third coast nigga, UGK 'bout to wreck shop
Man, I'm larger than life
These motherfuckers ask, "Is it the bark or the bite?"
It's both, chillin' on streets you scared to park on at night
Just forfeit just like I'm becoming part of the light
And you, you goin' to be the biggest mark at the fight
I never understood what made you think you was handlin'
You half-ass runnin' through my neighborhood vandlin'
Next time I'ma light your world up like a cannon
Get some Italians to play your ass like a mandolin
These cocaine wars got my mind in a frenzy
The feds tried to confiscate my 'lac and my Benzy
Colombian assassins hunt a nigga like Lindsey
And one of my workers came up short with my ends see
Shit, runnin' the streets used to be complicated
But now it's all easy, drug is strong arm related
But never can a bomb be faded
Fool ring the alarm, pour the Dom
I'm comin' down real shiny like candy paint
'Bout 3 in the morning, yawnin'
I wish I could come down but you know I can't
'Cause I'm leanin' off the dank and the good ole drank
I got 5 on the weed, 50 on the drank
Fool comin' down fuck what these hoes think
I wish I could come down but you know I can't
'Cause I'm leanin' off the dank and the good ole drank
3 in the morning, just turned over
Jumped into my clothes
Got to get around some hustlers movin' in the Chevy Nova
Done flagged me down for some more of that brown
To go with that green, now they sittin' on lean
Now the light is green, got to get the snaps
So I bails from the scene, the wash is still packed
With dealers and fiends freakin' for cheese and greens
See it's the same thing every night
Niggas pimpin' down G way and keepin' they head tight
Watchin' for laws 'cause you know they wanna hate
Jealous 'cause a nigga gettin' ahead of this paper chase
Can't place my face in these streets
But some niggas hustle just to eat
Niggas jackin' and packin', they playin' for keeps
No peace of mind, keepin' my heat behind
No seekers see a lie to be caught sleepin'
By another blue law out creepin'
While I'm chillin' gettin' sweeted
What you see is what the fuck you get
Young Pimp C baby comin' down real wet
I got a pump in the 'lac 'cause
These niggas tryin' to jack us
But we don't give a fuck, I got the AK in the back of
Came out the night club, 3 o'clock struck
Tryin' to holler at my people she in Lexus, I'm in truck
We 'bout to eat breakfast, we in Houston, Texas
The city of the crack, and the 'lacs, and the plexuhs
Say man I'm hollarin' at the body Courtney came with the love
We comin' down mang blowin' smoke in his lungs
'Cause I'm a candy sweet dipper, a big 'caine pimper
I'm playin' with the guitar, I'm squezzin' on the nipples
Even though this hoe look good and the pussy was tight
After I hiy, jump in my shit, I'm scratching off for the night
Fuck that laying in the bed with the hoe 'til the morning
Bitch I'm getting out here yawnin', coming back to reformin'
3 in the morning
3 in the morning

<SONGSTART>Pimp C:
Ugh

Steady Pushin' white at 16
Fuckin' hoe that's fine, smokin' on the kind
Used to mix the wine with the lean
Now we sip soda with the Barre
20 inch blades on the car
Choppin' on the road, blowin' on the dro
Shinin' in the sun like a star
You can't stay rich if you a bitch cuz hoes can't hold no bread
Fuck, 2 million niggas need a daddy other pussy niggas just scared
Tell your bitch to let me get some head
You ain't no pimp I knew you was a clone
I already hit nigga, it ain't shit nigga, I done left your bitch alone

But ain't shit whack so you better pull a quick guard
This shit is live enough to make your MOMMA'S dick hard
(C'mon!) Pick up ya phone and dial the 7 numbers that makes ya trip
for live shit comin from Bun B's lips
And I'm givin hoes the sensation of a big-ass nut

Courtesy of Bun B, straight to motherfuckin you
Yo, the nigga was trill, same shit, new place

Yeah niggaz be trippin yo, but still in the meanwhile

She might be shit to you, cause dude give her pay G
But pussy get played out, and pussy comes daily
As long as your game be strong ain't no thang
My phone always rang cause of the dope shit I sang
Keepin hoes on my dick yo, and ain't no lettin go
The net keeps flyin out, the pussy stays wet so
I turn on my VCR then I put a flick in
The hoe starts lickin that dick and pretty soon
I'm stickin that ass, like a fool in the bed
All I can see, is the top and back of your head
It ain't about conversation or make that hit
On a first name basis hoe that ain't bout shit!
Look trick, tell me how many rubbers to pack
I hit the room from the front, the ass from the back
And yo it ain't about the phone call, this about the nut'n
So let me bust a fat load on your bellybutton
See, quiet storm done put a notch on your belt
And when it's over, I don't wanna hear how it felt
I'm just pullin off my rubber, takin a bath
Gettin dressed to reminisce of how I cut ya in half
It's all in the day of an Underground fool
So dial the digits and I'm divin in that ass like a pool
But when I get wet BITCH, I won't be drownin
I clown on hoes to leave their pussyhole frownin
Or if you bitches wanna hear some more of this
Lock your bedroom door trick, pick up your cordless
You can suck a mean dick, lick a good ball
And if I keep on fuckin, you'll keep on callin
And I'll be playin you, when you think you'll be playin me
It's just pussy games with some help from AT&T
So if you need a dick to be real friendly
Dial nine-seven-six, B-U-N-B, bitch!

Ready to put dick in your face

She ain't goin nowhere, she love how I'm drillin it
Throw it up on her she throw it right, back
Bitch you know you like, that

I'm a dog that's gon' bite, back
Do it doggystyle I'm gon' hit that
For an hour or two, is you with, that?
Toot it up and I'ma tap that
Fully pack that, then I'ma smack that
Bring it back back, yeah right back
Bitch you know you like that ~!

Now my candy, is so fresh so clean
I break them boys off when I pull up on the scene
In my candy, with ten coats sprayed tight
And that Northside royal blue is settin off the white
On my candy, sho' ain't the average paint
You go to Ike tryin to buy it he gon't tell ya ya cain't
Have my candy, it's like a one-of-a-kind
And you might have a painted slab but it ain't pretty as mine
Cause my candy, worth mo' than money can buy
Brought it to Funkmaster Flex and seen a grown man cry
For my candy, sittin on nuttin but glass
Stoppin traffic on the freeway, when I fly past
In my candy, got no competition on the street
You can win a Dub car show and still can't compete
With my candy, cause it's the sweetest on the block
And I'm trill, workin the wheel, that's why they all jockin
My candy~!
[Chorus: singer]
Candy, painted, drop top, El Do', riiiide
("Break the boys on the ave cause the slab's so tight")
[Bun B:]
Now my candy, is sittin tall on them Vogues
It's like an alarm clock, wakin up all the hoes
My candy, is wetter than high tide
And it's lookin like I just had a blizzard inside
Of my candy, got mo' wood in it than a forest
One look'll get you hooked like a motherfuckin chorus
My candy, drips an unerasable stain
It's real magic, not like that motherfucker David Blaine
My candy, it got the woman on the front
And a Ph.D in showin niggaz how to stunt
My candy, it got the fifth up on the back
And it'll swang through your hood like it don't know how to act
My candy, the 8th wonder of the world
Like floatin downstream when you're starin at the swirls
My candy, ridin real trill, stayin true
And it's a legend in H-Town like DJ Screw
My candy
[Chorus: singer]
Just like candy, it's so sweet
Fadin niggaz, on these streets
People watch as I ride by
In my candy, I'm gon' shine
[Bun B:]
Now my candy, is so smooth, so laid
And these boys can't comprehend how the paint got sprayed
My candy, makin people stop drop and stare
Pull out any car you want to but it won't compare
To my candy, it's like a fo' wheel mirage
That's too pretty to park, in a motherfuckin garage
My candy, it's like a part of the fam'
So lose my friends or my ends I wouldn't give a damn
But my candy, is an extension of me
So when you lookin at my car you lookin at Bun B
It's my candy, player, throwed, fly
And you can't fuck with it no matter how hard you try
My candy, the other level of the game
If you ask me again, bitch I'ma tell you the same
It's my candy, yeah nigga mines not yearns
Long as I got syrup to sip, and Swishers to burn
In my candy

(Pimp C:)
Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggaz, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'ma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose
Cocaine, cocaine
(Bun B:)
They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Columbia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine
(Rick Ross:)
You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
And my yayo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

I still can't muthafucking quit
No Came

It's two wrongs on this track
Take the weight off my back
Remember don't blow my day
I'm a heart attack, Cohesive
Some mean shit, I just don't talk cold
I mean shit Comin down like Denzel in the Hurricane
Feel like they're starting fires
And igniting flames, anything
To take down No Came down
Taken for a conviction of triple
Murder, Rubin Carter's life was murdered,
Just like a black man criticized for controversy
Sometimes I start my own, most lies do hurt me
Coming down like a homicide victim,
Just cause I look and sound different
Comin down like James Bond, I'm on another
Mission 005.7 like the rate of homicide victims
Violent crimes are hard to retire, they never Will
I am fucking legend even if I am killed
I'm still that potion, to put haters
In to the motion, Say I'm the reason
For most to believe in, Let's say I'm everything
And there's nothing in between me, I'm
Still the muthafucking shit
I know everything
I know two things
I know nothing
I still can't muthafucking quit
West 3
Comin up, all I wanted to
Be in high school was a jock
A homecoming king, a volley-
Ball player, a boxer, a rockstar, a Rodney King
But no rapper has me beat
An actor, a rocker, a baseball
Player, a professional wrestler
Similar to Brock Lesnar
Even a ladies man, a bodybuilder
Once again a boxer, a skilled dribbler
A debater, snowboarder
A triathlete, a break dancer
Now I hate dancing, a wake boarder
Even a cheerleader, more like
A peer mediator, Who am I
Where's my first breath
Took profound leaps in every step,
I was even into football, ob course
Basketball, bring it soccer, even tennis
Can't stop winning, it's addictive
Life is a game board until you finish it
Even a lifeguard, but I still can't swim
I know everything
I know two things
I know three things
I still can't muthafucking quit
3x
I'm distill the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga
I still in it nigga
I'm still the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga
I know everything
I know two things
I know nothing
I still can't muthafucking quit

No Came
Comin down with that distilled
Never loved, better hated
Bring it hated, lifestyle
Coming down, once in
A while, you get good shoes now
Comin down with disappointment
Life is a deadly appointment
But it's important, know that's true
What's the difference between me and you
Comin down with the major talk
What am I going to do after college
Before I graduate, bring it Morgan
State, Comin down like
Bobby Brown
Last name a color and a noun
I have to cool it now
But I never will
When the world is hotter than Mills
And I'm not talking Texas County
I'm talking I will punish you
If you befoul me
Start a riot, if you lying
I still can't quit
till song ends
I'm distill the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga
I still in it nigga
I'm still the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga
I know everything
I know two things
I know nothing
I still can't muthafucking quit
It's great

(feat. Infinity)
[Infinity]
Well, it's me, the I-N-F-I-N-I-T-Y
comin on the m-i-c to let you know that I
I'm sick and tired of weak-minded two cents brothas
Only out for one thing, and that's to get you undercovers
You wanna lick me down, strap me down
Think you're gonna toss on me, well I won't be around
For you to put wear-and-tear on my body
If you know like I know
You better go cause I ain't even hottie
To tell you the truth, you ain't that major
Cause you made a little album and you getting the papers
Well, it's my turn and you're catchin the vapors
Before you know it, you'll be askin for favors
Remember back in PA?
When you were constantly jockin and callin my everyday
The truth hurts huh, and you won't admit
Cause, you're too busy thinking you're the shit
YOU'RE CRAMPIN MY STYLE!
[Bun B]
Hold up dammit, you got the wrong man
I hate to bust your bubble
but, I'm down to drop a load, then I'm gone man
Ain't with no relationships and suckin on toes
I LIKE A ONE NIGHT STAND, JUST KICK IT WITH SOME HOES!
You down with that jimmie, then it's on!
The 9-2 king of the quickie, so get me then I'm gone
Just open up, and you gone get got
Ain't no kissin and huggin, I leave you sleepin in the wet spot
Let me in it, and let me out
Wham bam thank you ma'am, yeah that's what it's all about!
And, don't take it personal when I bail on ya
Just smoke a cigarette and kick it in the sauna
Cause havin me all on ya ain't the lick
You're down for a love affair
BUT SEE, I'M ONLY DOWN FOR A QUICK STICK!
So, check your watch or your clock
Cause, I ain't about havin nobody feenin on my jock!
YOU'RE CRAMPIN MY STYLE!
[Infinity]
I got to have some time to get to know ya, let me date ya
Cause one night stands ain't really in my nature
I need some substance to take it
I love you on the first night, ain't even gonna make it
Cause broken hearts, I don't had enough of
I need sensuality, not a bunch of broke love
If you can provide it, let's have it
Take your time baby, stop jumpin like a rabbit
Let's start somethin on a come-up
We can have it goin on here from sun-down to sun-up
Don't try to run up in me fast
I want to find out how long can B-U-N B last
Pass the ice and the honey, the money you can keep
Watch your back at all times, one eye open when you sleep
I can't have you for a part-time lover
Infinity has found another
CAUSE YOU'RE CRAMPIN MY STYLE!
[Bun B]
Love you down but only for a little time
B-C-B, baby, I'm goin down for mine
My my my, I see you want me to spend the night
No, not quite, I did my part, now I'm takin flight
You just might see me again, but not soon
You can keep the wedding
I JUST WANT THE HONEYMOON!
You might be good, but see - that ain't even the point
I got all that I wanted, now I'm out of this joint
So, you can pass me my draws and pass me my cap
Cause, I ain't go be here when you wake up from your nap
And, that's the haps, no ifs ands or buts
Now, pass my matchbox, so I can hit the cut
I love them guts, but not enough to stick around
So when I raise up, you can keep on layin down
I HATE TO CLOWN, BUT THAT'S LIFE AS I SEE IT
YOU'RE LOOKIN FOR A FULL-TIME MAN, I CAN'T BE IT!
YOU'RE CRAMPIN MY STYLE!

<SONGSTART>You lost yo' spot when you went pop

(Hol' up, hol' up bitch!)
You lost your cars, and yo' house
Now you sleep on yo' mama's couch
But the game been good to meeeee...
UHH, first album went platinum, now you can't go gold
Made ya deal with the devil, but you sold yo' soul
You rent a lotta cars, rent a mansion and them hoes
You say you sold your Phantom, bitch they took yo' Rolls
Get disrespected everywhere you go
Big bodyguards when you come for the shows
They already know you got shit on your name
Nigga, you a pussy, they gon' take yo' chain
Take yo' piece, rings and watch
You play rich, boy you need to stop
I ain't dissin nobody, no particular name
Ya shoe fit nigga, get the fuck up out the game - lil' BITCH!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
I'm a Down South MC, I'm cold on the mic
I say it how I feel and I do it how I like
I write what I see, what I do, and what I know
And keep it one hundred off top from the do'
Now whether at a show, in the booth, or on the street
No matter where I go and no matter who I meet
Everybody tryna tell me how they feel 'bout the South
On the cool, them haters need to shut they fuckin mouth
'Cause we grip grain, nigga we pop trunk
We to' straps and we ready for the funk
Some niggaz two-step, some niggaz dance
Some niggaz just ball wit' a bottle in they hands
Sell a couple ringtones niggaz, that's bread
You hatin on paper get that FUCK up out yo' head
Worryin 'bout my cheese, getcha own stack
It's goin down in the South, you don't like it
Click clack, motherfucker!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
You got caught with that work on 10
Made a deal with the state to turn your foul partner in
But he took 15, befo' you could tell
He ain't witchu no mo' hoe, you got twenty in a cell
I sent you a lawyer, you ain't listened that time
Ain't no appeal, but they dropped it to five?
Who you had to fuck to give back that time?
Textin me from a cell phone - bitch, yo lost YO' FUCKIN MIND?
How dare you tryna get me on conspiracy, Jack?
If the feds hit me, I'ma hit yo' ass BACK!
You fight witcho tounge, I send 'em killa
Transcript writer, I'll kill you nigguuuh!
(Smoke sum'hin, bitch.)
Got caught with the shit, twenty years

Bought me all, of yo' dough.

<SONGSTART>I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pimpin' down the ave you know I'm lookin' tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that
Who's says he's going through a thang
When ya'll ain't never lied
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
When I hurt and try to hate 'cause she knows the thrill is gone
Say man, I stop smokin' with haters back in ninety four
But niggas thinkin' that a sweeps gone get the through my door
And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye to eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight
And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this away
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away
My dead homey momma's tear shit
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 503
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets just keep on gettin' live with me
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin' that
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains
It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to ESG and all the victims of the game
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I'm pimpin' through the ave. tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown, when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuck 'n' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood

Nigga, everybody rappin' like they ballin' and they rich

They diamonds ain't shinin' and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm grippin' on the grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm workin' wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville, your step daddy can get killed
If he keeps talkin' shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you tryin' to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the South
For them niggas and them girls with them golds in they mouth
The boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill, bitch you ain't what this about, about
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit

We ain't got nothin' to gain but I got everythin' to lose
So I'm forever bring the blues to the issue
Pick and choose if I miss ya, stick and move when I diss ya
Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, it was made for me to gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my
Flow fly, dope my, wait awhile you know why? Why?
Too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars, baby ballin'
Bullshitter, frontin' like rottweiliers, no bark, no bite
But showin' thangs, talkin' loud like they knowin' thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane, your ass mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight, it ain't no passin' tonight
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit

Waitin' for me to fall but yet they comin' off the wall
Till I'm ready, keep the gun steady and ready
For anybody crossin' the line with get that fuck shit

Got the radio on pump when I come through a slump
Remember me, The one that had your back up in the club
Remember me, The one that bring you on and show you love

With a rusty ass niner lookin' for trouble
So what? I know the same streets you know
Yeah, so what? I go the same places you go
I got the mark in my skin so you know my set
I'm the heart, you the place, I'm always first, you always late
I'm the king in these streets till the muthafuckin' end

A bad day for the niggaz in my click
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It's seems the drug situation is so tow up
And poes down the fuckin T-X had to show up
I got shit on the scene so 99 can't hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret and there's no rest
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
In Dynasties.I-ROCs... and Caravans and muthafuckas are swolen
Like paper stacks and a rubberband
Goin all out of tact on the local bird slaggin brothaman
And be servin as slow as fuck
Cause my niggaz are nervous
and if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggaz is happy with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town
Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my tags off my buick and yall know I didn't love that
Rollin on some white balls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, YOU GOTS TO DO YOUR OWN NAILS!
I told my niggaz to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town
God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back up!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my click
Got the birds, and reopen my lab back up
And told my boys, "If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye,
Don't give him a chance to identify!"
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at random, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Close to the dopeman - God damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
CAUSE IN MY YARD IS A BIG ASS - I GOT YALE SIGN!
It's time for TONY MONTANA stacks
I got niggaz on the corner holdin big ass bags and cans of crack
The land of Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fools run in with your glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last love
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight lights

You could roll with the playas on the million dollar mission, c'mon

You're confident, you out here puttin it down for yo' kids

He ain't teachin you nothin, you need to learn me
Check out my mind, I'm 24 on the grind

And I don't get caught up in "he say, she say"

With the feminine fat, in all the right places
She look me in my eyes and she make all the right faces
Cause she's a real catch, we make a tough pair
A true dynamic duo and we up there
We sittin tall at the top
And if she ride or die for me playa I'm a give her all that I got
I break her off and not, let her hold the keys
I don't take her out of town, man I take her oas
It ain't trickin if you spend it on your lady
Bring the bacon home to baby and everything'll be gravy
Just let me know if that's soundin like a plan
Cause all you really need to change your life is the man
And you appealin to the King of the Trill and

(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush inside ? ? is fresh
Triple gold double-A Dayton's is the best, ugh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cos where I'm from fool that's what everybody play
UGK-1 written smooth on my plates
Cos real pimp players don't never roll fake
I'm bout to hit Dove Way, get past Troy's
I'm dippin by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass by the Colt I see some women lookin fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the trigger so it bump, ugh
I know you player-hatin busters wanna ride man
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy
(Hook - x2)
(Pimp C)
It's pimpin pimpin, I'm hittin switches, checkin out my strap
but I keep on dippin, steady pimpin, kickin, how's about the winter man?
Makin sure these snitches, ain't stoppin riches, 5-Oh on my back
I'm chillin, hidin and winnin, pockets feelin fat
(Bun B)
And I come round your corner shinin, leanin, ever so sunnin
Gangstas put down their gun and
women and children come outside and start runnin
They catch a glimpse of the P-A pimp whoopin whips
Never goin out out like simps, walkin your block with gangsta limp
(Pimp C)
Some fool roll Lincoln, some fools roll Jag
but the crew from Texas roll them Lacs, white gloss and rags
With the candy paint and wheel and grill, and wooden dash
'94 I gotta keep it trill, down for my cash
(Bun B)
I gots my stash so I switches, keep on burnin
and these tyres keep on turnin
I be rollin through your scene, flashin green, freaks be yearnin
to be down, the Under Ground Kingz drinkin Crown with the Coke
Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby
(Hook - x2)
(Bun B)
It's the tough boy, boulevard niggas, rollin around tan up
All four corners on your block fool, nuttin but that bunny hop
happenin, high gassin, daily routine, my load is plush
Interior crush and fool I'm through clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
in your soul so letta player take control
And do what the hell ya been waitin
to see and that's me rollin on three Dayton's
Wit one of them thangs in the air, it's hangin up there
Shinin steel fat man, but I don't care if everybody sit back and stare
Everywhere we go they linin up as if we're startin up a parade
And everybody thinkin they get paid
But I don't really give a damn, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
on a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right

Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin, on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin, on me, they wanna fuck my car
Look a nigga up and down like he a superstar
But they ain't trippin, on me, they wanna fuck my car

Ay C keep yo' eyes open for the boppers, car hoppers
Daisy Dukes out on the block, showin cock, traffic stoppers
Lookin good spendin some nigga G's
Nails by Vietnamese, [unverified], lookin' like they worth G's
Dress above they knees, jellies and G-strings up the ass
Man I never let 'em pass
So, tell me where can I find 'em
With they nigga or in that candy Cadillac right behind him
Bitches tellin' me see yo' dick grand
All she wanna do is ride Su-bur-ban
Put her ass on the leather and rub the wood
See we got boppers in Texas oh, man that pussy look good
So, I let them hoes ride and I show them a grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
When she told me I looked good I didn't feel no pride
All the bitch wanted to do is just fuck my ride
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car

Oh yeah, these hoes think they cute in skin-tight catsuits
Assumin' that they body's too boomin to dispute
But pussy is the root of all drama
An attribute put up in they head by they momma
Oh yeah, I'ma tell it like it is, I sees how it goes down
Niggaz talkin' 'bout, how they passin' these hoes 'round
But y'all trickin', them hoes told me
Fools y'all ain't Goldy, ridin' in a goodie but an oldie
Fifty dollars there, a hundred dollars here
You brought the bitch a drink and all her homegirls a beer
Your homeboys lookin for ya, but yo' ass gone
You left your niggaz at the club and took all them hoes home
And didn't even fuck, man what the fuck
If you didn't want to fuck then get the fuck up out the truck
You know what I mean? I ain't showin out Vogues
Just so these hoes can be seen, c'mon you wanna fuck or cut?
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
When you look at my chrome and you lick your lips
It's just like I'm rubbin' my dick between your hips
And when you smile and shake your ass, my grill smile right back
Bitch I'm the real, that's why I ride Cadillac
And I'ma fuck you and fuck all yo' friends
Soon as Pimp C come through in that 600 Benz
With burgundy paint, butter and LG rims
Color TV, VCR playin X-rated films
Of myself, runnin up in beauty queens
But let me tell y'all niggaz the difference between y'all and me
You see, man I can tell all that bitch wanted to do
Is just ride for free and smoke for free
But bitch not me, you better ask them hoes if my name Pimp C
Unless your pussy makin ten thousand dollars a week
The only way I see you sittin in my passenger seat, you bitch!
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
Look a nigga up and down like he a superstar

Where the hoes, where the hoes
lookin', lookin', tighten up, tryin' to tighten up
where the hoes, where the hoes
check it out
Verse 1 (pimp c):
I'm coming down candy, i put in my work
got a $10, 000 link medalion hangin' on a $2000 shirt
the game's been good
and all the hoes wanna sit on leather and the wood
bitches tryin' to price my diamonds
but that shit is just so common
'cause they see a nigga shinin'
but i'm movin' too fast
96 karats if you think that you could manage
got the drink and the salad
now the bitch is on the?
i'm comin' down gulf way, i'm tryin' to see what's up
i see big ass and some titties
now we flippin' in the 'bourbon to the city
the attitude's shitty but i bought no plex
ain't talkin' 'bout the malcolm but i'm ridin' on the x
the highway was so wet, i'm slippin' out my lane
the bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
i bet you never seen a big truck like that
i bet you never got a dick sucked like that
the bitch didn't know that i was tapin' the whole scene
now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen
the glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
i got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
tryin' to close me down, but i got ghetto love
i'm pimp c bitch, i'm comin' down richer than rich
so bitch you know you gotta gimme good stuff
Chorus:
Lookin' for that good stuff
ba ba ba ba da da da
tighten up on that backstroke
ba ba ba ba da da da
lookin' for that good stuff
tighten up on that backstroke
comin' down on fresh paint
blowin' swisher sweet smoke
Verse 2 (bun-b):
We flippin' worldwide, p.a.t. international jetsetters
bigger than the hollywood letters
but don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
breakin' off the jealous with pitch black barettas
my fellas and tellers who holdin' plates against them texas boys
bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex
like you major boy you have done played yourself
too $hort smoked you like a newport, and you bought
a one-way ticket to something bigger than you
over your head and got scared
exactly what i figured you'd do
now who you kiddin', i'm slangin', bangin', and skiddin'
busta playa moves and if you done it and did it
as i sit in the lap of luxury
dea is tryin' to stick bugs to me
undercover motherfucker tried to sell drugs to me
what could be more throw
mafioso puttin' bombs under my load
never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
now i'm comin' down shinin'
pieces and chains full of diamonds
i'm winin' and dinin' and caligula
pretty boys gettin' off the hook
bitches sayin' but i'm diggin' ya
but i know that make ya mega crunk
and make ya make it man it make a niggas wanna pop trunk
got skunk from the rasta, eatin' steak and lobster
like a mobster and gots to be lookin' for the good stuff
Chorus
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Uhhhhhhhh ~!
If you know like I know you would get down on the flo'
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisha full of 'dro
We can get down for my dime and we can f**k, on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha f**kin with me fo'?
Every lady ain't a hoe and every hoe ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't f**k around with no punks
Ride with me she holdin a pistol while I'm whippin and poppin the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems 'long as she hear what the f**k I said
Pimpin ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here livin by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm lookin at you you choosin me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm superstar, we headed to the top
(Chorus: sung)
I'm stayin true, I'm out here whippin my Mercedes
F**kin with the midnight ladies - the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm bangin Screwwww, my young girl lookin fine
We stayin out here on the grind - and keepin money on our mi-ii-iind
(Bun B:)
Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, gotta feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster-ass persona so hard it can dent, steel
In the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leakin fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust

Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leakin out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you gotta go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Gotta pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Gotta play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's yo' turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a f**k how you feel
(Chorus)
(Pimp C:)
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the SOOOOOOOOOUTH
This scary hoe don't wanna know what it's ABOOOOOOOOUT
Cause I stay country true down to the co', dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws, feel it tighten up don't stop don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars, f**k the D.A. f**k the law
I f**k the snow but I love a pro like flatbackers I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer, drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker, bitch around me man I'ma mack her
(Bun B:)
From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of 'dro and Impala bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki', and ten kilos grams in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's one point five mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is tickin, time is pressin
No second guessin, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK
(Chorus)

In the ghetto they gotta suffer for shit that they ain't did
By no fault of they own, goin' through struggles and strife
Havin' to deal with a fucked up life
I know they thinkin' nobody knows or nobody cares
Why can't nobody see the shit, when everybody stares
Man we losin' the children, we losin' the youth
'Cause you motherfuckers won't tell 'em the truth
So they runnin' 'round unprepared and uninformed
It's understood that's why the hood is dumpin' on 'em
We gotta show 'em it's a better way at any cost
'Cause they the future if we don't save 'em then we already lost mayne

'Cause if it is then I better get on my knees boy
I got cheese boy, I'm sellin' niggaz sneeze boy
I'm playin' in the candy torture rim with TV like my Roy
I'm wonderin' if it's a heaven for MCs
Like the Freaky Tah's, the Big L's and B.I.G.'s
I wonder if they got a heaven for the Convicts
Niggaz doin' life, I saw old men in that bitch
I wish today that the Lord take me away
I'd get to see my old man and I wonder what he would say
I feel that, I miss Munroe too
If I could brin' him back I'd give up all this shit fool
But on the cool you know what else I hope is true
They got a heaven for me and got a heaven for you too
I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's

We livin' that hi life
Hi life
We livin' that hi life
I'm tired livin' f**ked up, tired of livin' bad
Tired of grandmama telling me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm tryin to live up to the image
That she would want me to be
But I got one foot in the street and every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G but Niggas depend on me
It ain't fake to hit a 10 so niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushing cocaine niggas holding pistols
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20, 000 tryin' to turn it into a hundred, and ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas came to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch thinking she can ease my mind by suckin' my dick
Bitch make up for a minute cause that ship never last
In 1996 niggas is dyin' from layin' on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Easy-E died
And you be wonderin' why you niggas
Out there smokin'cri
I wish that I could tell y'aIl wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that nigga you know that I would be lyin'
And I been f**kin' pussy since the tender age of nine
It's gettin' to be a full-time job just tryin' to stay alive
And crack a scandalous smirk offended by the weed
Smoke comin' of my shirt
But I still put in work and front for my folks
'cause where I come from nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe
Some say that nigga's sellin' dope
And you know I ain't lyin' that just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the devil poke you
With his fork
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophet, f**kin' hoes
And gettin' paid
I'm looking for that
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life
You only got one life to live that's all they give us to do it
You could bullshit your way through it or stay true
It can be complicated cause niggas
Be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the people
In the lane get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive, take your positions
With pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dust
To see the only stretch rest see how we was left to be
Down these streets that we be on
Motherf**kers sleepin' on them corners that you be on
Probably because society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the f**k made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas sellin' that dank
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of the American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on who gives a damn
When you can't afford a turkey or ham
Livin' off of Ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab, it's far from me
To push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your man
And so instead of being without I'm hustlin' tryin' to
Get through these ungodly days
Thinkin' of ways to get the f**k out of this maze
A man'll commit a crime who the& f**k it crime pays
I'm goin' through a phase you don't go out until you
Out reason a motherf**ker
Gots to pour out this 40 on the curb, disturbed and
Left with no doubt in this mind
But still sometimes he don't know why he walkin' around just hopin'
He can get one more try to make it
It's a bullshit he goin' through but yo he gots,
You can't fake it to get the
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life

Pull out that K in a day and get done away like you fake
Straight out P-A short Texas, servin trees on the West (West)

With the cream and the cash, by any means I'ma mash
So go get my green out the stash, walk with that beam in ya ass

Flo', you niggaz say you want a better price
Price, you got it but it ain't gon' hook right
Drop seven on lock tight, fuck wit it the whole night
Try to hit and she hid the Sprite, got you mad like Tina and Ike
Ike, my product always cover up good
Good, nigga I can put that on my neighborhood
Hold Arthur right on the water, white powder and hella snorter
Nigga wanna buy eight I brought 'em
slowly off and then I ate in the squadda
Uhh, now nigga look at how the time change
Change, check out the Jordans on this wide frame
Whippin out and grippin gram, new truck or candy slant
Makin young girls drop it I, hit the slab bitch hit the block
Let me get these niggaz for you Pimp!
Let me handle this shit for you Bun, I got you!
You know it's a team, UGK alumni
Ain't nuttin!

Ask yourself, cheap in Texas if you can drive past
Besides that, nigga current or make five cents
It's seven eight or nine, seventh time a month supply that
By fifty thousand, no more browsin, bitch I'm buyin that
I'm ridin 'Llac with three old Benzes right behind that
Fifth comin down we be flexin, fives and sixes in GTS's
Chrome tips with VVS's, neck and chest in VVS's
Oh yes it's, the mob better get your mind right
Ay Tip ain't goin home, that don't even sound right
You niggaz actin like a broad, I don't wanna fight
Nah I ain't gon' squab but I will have a gun fight
We finna hit the streets with the glock, with the G's in the block
Trappin on like a traffic stop, then sooner or later I have a knot
Got money from Bankhead to Groverland, fuck your head back to Simpson Road
Down South fakers known for gettin paper
then some of the hill niggaz still know, for sho' they know
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Dear Lord, I know You don't condone
The things I be doin' out here in these streets
And I hope that, I pray that You can overlook
The wrong that I had done in my life
I don't know no other way to survive out here
I got a whole bunch of people dependin' on me
Just walk with me, walk with me
Busslin' and gamblin', hit licks scramblin'
Bricks, I'm out here handlin', I'm pimpin' and I'm payin' the rent
Didn't choose this dirty game, this dirty game, it chose me
Every city love cocaine, they'll get it from him
If they don't get it from me
So I get cross-country with that thang
Makin' that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin' that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
'Cause I put up sum from every sale so all my children can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell
But just put me in woodgrain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that sweet down 'cause that bullshit don't apply to me
'Cause out here on the real streets a dreamer always stay sleep
'Cause out here the strong survive
And now they didn't die from thankin' weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it hard, still tryna get right with God
Still read my Bible lone 'cause Reverend do wrong, still livin' fraud
Tonight if I get down on my knees
And ask the Lord to forgive me, please
You thank He gon' hear me?
'Cause tomorrow I'm still gon' be slangin' ki's
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
See, I was born in the ghetto, manye, I was raised in the hood
And unless you lived it yourself, it just can't be understood
People think hustlin' is cool or hustlin' is live
They don't understand hustlers only hustlin' to survive
They wished they lived in the 'burbs, wished they didn't have to hang
Out on corners in low-income house in projects and slang
They wish their daddy was home, mama wasn't on drugs
And they didn't have to grow up to be dealers and thugs
Po' children got aspirations and dreams just like the wealthy
But it's hard when that environment you live in ain't healthy
You ain't givin' no hope, nobody showin' you pride
And you live with all this anger and frustration inside
Dog, don't let nobody tell you what you can or you can't do
Just 'cause they funky ass couldn't do it, they ain't you
You can be who you wanna be, live life how you feel
Just put your faith in the Lord, now that's keepin' it trill fo' real
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's
For all the niggaz in the game that's been slangin' cheese
For all them boys on them swangers and their fifth wheel
I'm out here riskin' my life, niggaz shife but I stay trill
I pray so much, I wonder if the Lord love me
I think He do but I'm so caught up in my thug deep
The feds bug me, followin' me around for three
Niggaz couldn't catch me so they hit me with conspiracy
You know that that's the other level of the game
Ain't got shit on me but some niggaz said my name
So here they come, they thang tight
They playin' shife, no Bun, givin' me life
I ain't goin' back, I'm a make 'em kill me
I'ma bust back, fuck the pen, you feel me?
Wish I can hug my momma and kiss my baby girl
I know it's a better place than livin' in this dirty world
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Some people win and some people lose
Some always cryin' the blues, yeah
Some people win, some people lose
Some always bein' misused
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
'Cause I need You, Lord, right now
I need You, right now
Need Ya, I need Ya, I need Ya
I need Ya 'cause I'm goin' and livin' too fast, yeah
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Out here livin' too fast, how long can it last?
I can't get up, Lord, can You help me?

[Verse]
My baby mama brother came and told me some shit
About a nigga talking about Pimp C ya wig'll get split
I laughed then I dashed cause I'm fucking your chick
She told me all she wanna do is ride my dick
She kick it with the nigga cause he give her the stacks
But every fucking night I try to break her fucking back
And now a nigga say that he wanna fight
But if you fucking around I'll put that fire in his life
[Bun B]
Man keep fucking it raw
And if he's trip then it's on
Never let a nigga say you a broad prove him wrong
Fool, I'm fucking this nigga girl now and he know it
Got a pistol but wont blow it, talking shit but wont show it
Yo it ain't nothing going on but nuts on they tricks
They never faking licks, sucking dick while I'm taking shits
I do a bitch bad and treat a nigga worse than that
And make sure you show him that fat gat you left wet for him fool
[Chorus]
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya nigga (*whisper* I left it wet x3)

[Pimp C]
I went to my nigga got that liquor dark
My nigga 3-2 came down with the water
A dip, dip, nigga trip, trip ya fried
I took my fucking pistol and shot a dopey in his eye
I ain't got no love for you fucking hos
I'm hot from smoking click, gotcha drippin on my fucking clothes
I got that fire bumpin in my brain
I'm thinking to myself, I need to go to selling caine
And all the time I'm bumpin W.C.
Cause it seem like he the only nigga making sense to me
And the shit ain't really the same
It's moving too fast, I just switched all of my aim
I'm rollin' in a raggedy ride, thinking about suicide
Puffing the green outside, nigga
And all the time I'm fried
I left it wet for ya nigga
[Chorus]
I left it wet for ya nigga (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya nigga (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya nigga (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
[Bun B]
I never loved a punk ass, sorry son of a bitch
Which is why I can't lie about the hate I said it straight
And never switched up my opinion, if you ain't down, you ain't down
That's that, just go get your gat little bitch
Holla back when your pistol pack
I promise anybody trying to be a bold bastard
Getting fried like that dip, I'm full of that dank and ready to trip
It's been a lot of niggaz swearing that they hard
Like I care and I be sharing slugs with some of them studs
And some of their barin, darin
Hoes and half playas, and hit the blunt and give it away
And see which one these niggaz wont be living today
Hey what's up? Got me a cup of that irk and jerk
Putting in work until I'm blown and never the 5-4 bitch
Cause I'm too cold, I expose like a bomb dropping them daily
So don't say we never told ya, how a trill nigga fold ya
Texas trilla O big baby, maybe you didn't know I gets my blast on
and let loose some of this stress, leaving blood all over your chest
Yes, I left it wet for ya fool
[Chorus]
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)

<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part."
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it"
"Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets"
"Had to tie her to a rocket"
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up"
"Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up"
"(Shit)"

My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F*** it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that b**** do you dirty
we'll wipe her a** out and send detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C)
Sweet jones
My b**** a choosey lover, never f*** without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for 40 dollars in the club
f***** up the game, b**** you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them b****es too scary
Your b**** chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Bun B)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
Because its greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
Im a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar b****
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C & B U N B
Cause whats a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoe
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose
OOOooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi)
Eeny mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl dont touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the C-Support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers couldn't stop the
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last pump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooooohhhhh Ooooooohhh
I chose you girl
IIIIiiii
I chose you baby

But you know what I want you to do, tell 'em where you from!
[Bun B:]
Niggaz always askin what the fuck do trill stand for?
Trill mean if you ain't my nigga, what you shakin my hand for?
Trill mean if you ain't my bitch, don't sit on my lap
And if you ain't from P.A.T., nigga keep ya strap
The trill drink Olde E., out on 7th Street in Texas
Drive a 'Lac, or a Buick, motherfuck a Lexus!
Trill niggaz got the big nuts and big dicks
So what they hittin fo', fool? Roll that 4-5-6
Either wearin Dickies or they sportin Hi Fashion
Sellin dope and hatin doin {? } with a passion
Laws on the creep, so look for the nine twice
I bail to the shackle five-oh-three and roll some dice
Trill niggaz hit the car wash and make 'em shine
You better watch yo' ass when you see the 99
The trill niggaz only hit the streets when it's the night
At Circle K.R. Churches, to see who wanna fight
We don't take to new faces, quit airin P.A.T.
You cain't just runnin talkin 'bout - "Aiyyo, wassup G?! "
Why you pullin out you hand? I'm pullin out my gat
Catch a blast muthafucka, you don't know where you at
Cause see now P.A.T. don't stand for "Punk Ass Tricks"
It's "Pullin All Triggers" and we pull them hoes quick
You talkin to a nigga with trigger-finger twitch
If you ain't from P.A.T., I'm unloadin on you bitch!
Ain't no punks where I'm from!

Niggaz ain't trippin', so I gets to keep my chrome down
And I be dippin' around the spots that niggaz pass
Swisha's, serving to the fiends, calling me
Mr. Big Buns, snatching checks from your momma
Making dollars, hoes holla, hustling bring ya drama
Uh but I don't sweat it fool, I come from where the best ride
Ain't no punks where I'm from on that West side
PA nigga, outta town with big nuts
Where outta town motherfuckers lose they life on the cut
But we ain't trippin', pass that dipplin'
And it's gonna be all right, soon as I get fried tonight
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
Well, I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm smoking big fat dank
I don't fuck around no mo with that goddamn drank
But every time I get down with my nigga Big Mike
We go and get a bottle of that Dom all night
I got that green monster baby, can you buy that?
Plus I got Swisha suit for days, you wanna try that?
I roll them, most of them big and fat they look like ball bats
I live in P A T, the East side, niggas sayin' jack
These laws be trippin' 'cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it in cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living a Mac
And I ain't trippin', flippin' then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
'Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble

Niggas ain't real, must'a started smokin' rocks
It all fell down, 'cause they was bitin' too much pac
But what goes up, must come down
While these bitches suckin' dick
And droppin' to the ground
But what goes up, must come down
While these bitches suckin' dick
And droppin' to the ground
But what goes up, must come down
While these bitches suckin' dick

City, every town, I'm ballin' in the mix
I'm servin' niggas bricks
Keep a bad yellow bitch
On my team, sippin' lean
Ain't no thang of the past
The '84 Beritz with the slant back ass
Keepin' me a pro, next to my fo'
Instead of stackin' cheese
He steady screamin' to that hoe, let me see it
Fuck ass nigga, fuck ass nigga
Get yo' mind on yo' money

Representin' that south, that south
And this ain't no muthafuckin' Hip-Hop records
These country rap tunes, hol' up
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART><SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>eah, see I remember, how it all be-gan
I used to slang dirty raps to my P.A. fans
And back then, I knew you couldn't stop this flow
No other MC around can go like I go
I brought the new style in and the bass it got crunker
I bought me a slab and now I'm a pop trunker
Do I wanna rap or swang on 4's
Your brother's comin down slammin Cadillac do's
People tellin me that it's just my time
They know it's UGK for life and I get down for mine
14 on the mic and you never seen me play
Big Dick Cheney and comin straight up outta P.A.
Port Authur Texas, the land of the trill
And fuck your diamonds man these boys a put a gun to your grill
It's Bun Beeda, you know that I be reppin mayne
See we done said it befo', but we gon' say it agayn
Life is...
Too $hort don't you agree?
While I'm livin my life, don't fuck with me
(Life is...) too short, whippin the slab
Comin down blowin sweets and hurtin hoes on the ave
I've been crushin these niggaz, me and Bun B
Been a legend since 1993
Gimme thirty thousand and I'll serve ya some heat
I'll write your rhymes, sang the hook, and I'll make ya a beat
I used to dream about this shit, now my money is legit
Ain't no mo' ridin up that ten with that shit tryin to win
I let the young whippersnapper take all the risks
They'll serve a nigga dope and now it's all on a disk
Keep a bad yella bitch and a thick young brown (brown)
Top dropped down when I'm ridin through the town (town)
Y'all call 'em trues (trues) we call 'em Vogues (Vogues)
They call 'em shorties (shawty) we call 'em hoes (hoes)
Y'all niggaz behind still playin with'cha nose
I got two matchin Bentleys just bought me a Rolls
My momma drive a BM and my gul got a Benz
Watchin life through my rearview I see haters in my lens
Life is...
Too $hort don't you agree?
While I'm livin my life, don't fuck with me
(Life is...) too short, whippin the slab
Comin down blowin sweets and hurtin hoes on the ave
Life is too short, that's what I always say
We wasn't homies last week so don't call me today
I ain't got nuttin for you, can't loan you shit
Don't you hate when broke niggaz be on yo' dick?!
I can make a lot of money, I know I can
But the mo' I make, the mo' I spend
Lot of cash in my pockets just to show my friends
I can put it in the bank to buy fo' mo' rims
For my fo' do' Benz, with the royal blue paint
Sometimes you wanna quit, but you know you can't
You gotta keep hustlin or you lose it all
If you choose to ball you pay your dues and fall
I said fuck bein broke, if I gotta sell coke
I'm a rock the shit up and raise hell with my folks
I'll be posted on the block, at night I gotta get mine
I'll pimp hoes and I do white collar crimes
Cause life is...
Too $hort don't you agree?
While I'm livin my life, don't fuck with me
(Life is...) too short, whippin the slab
Comin down blowin sweets and hurtin hoes on the ave
Now life is to some people unbearable
They tellin on they homeboys and that's terrible
Was it way too much time or nothin big
Cause if you tell on us, we'll be splittin your wig
Now my freedom is to me my main asset
So I'm a keep it 100, and give like I get
Chill at the Ponderosa and smoke that good
I'm tryin to get rich while I rep for the hood
See everybody's got that same old dream
Of big cars, bad bitches and a mountain of green
Drive a brand new Bentley, Benzo or a Beem
But ain't none of that worth tellin on yo' team
It's on you homeboy, so what'chu gon' do
You need to take my advice and stop snitchin fool
Or you can close yo' ears, and run yo' mouth
But when they catch you homeboy you'll soon find out
Life is...
Too $hort don't you agree?
While I'm livin my life, don't fuck with me
(Life is...) too short, whippin the slab
Comin down blowin sweets and hurtin hoes on the ave
Life is...
Too $hort don't you agree?
While I'm livin my life, don't fuck with me
(Life is...) too short, whippin the slab
Comin down blowin sweets and hurtin hoes on the ave

And I'm bringing this paper faster than
These other lil bastards can
So I'm digging in my mind for the bitches I broke
And keep a player paid in full cause pimping ain't no joke
You want to pop that pussy that's a slim ass chance
Put the paper in the panties when you get that dance
This C.O.D. nigga, so you can keep your nuh plastic cards
No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers
But why slap us when you think a nigga down on his luck
You try and flag us when you see us coming down in a buck
Now what the fuck part of the game taught y'all that bitch play
See we makes a bitch pay
Like a bitch weigh
And then a bitch stay
Wouldn't sit still
Fuck how this shit feel
This ain't studio pimping
This shit real pimping
I got them bitches popping pussy getting buck (getting buck)
And you know that we couldn't give a fuck (give a fuck)
I got them bitches on the corner selling cock (selling cock)
And the game that we go don't stop (don't stop)
I got them thug ass niggaz with the syrup (with the syrup)
And you know that we always blowing herb (blowing herb)
And in the club man you know we stay strapped (stay strapped)
And bitch you know that it ain't about this rap (ain't about this rap)
To many niggaz out here buying hoes a meal
Nigga that ain't the way a bitch supposed to feel
I close the deal from the front door
Fuck me right and suck me tight
And you just might hit the blunt hoe
I don't stunt and blow smoke up your ass baby
But don't be acting all saditty with class baby
You with a nigga such as my self it'll cost you
So pay before a nigga fuck around and be the tosser
Sweet Jones, gripping grain
With all that shit you talk ain't got no bezatine chain
And most of y'all niggaz ain't nothing but tricks
But we sipping lean and breaking bricks
Popping pills, work the wood wheel
Fuck where you're from and fuck how you feel
If you want to go to war I'll take you to war
I got an AK-47 and a tek in the car
I got them bitches popping pussy getting buck (getting buck)
And you know that we couldn't give a fuck (give a fuck)
I got them bitches on the corner selling cock (selling cock)
And the game that I got don't stop (don't stop)

And everyday young boys that's paid (that's paid)
Lay it down when we chopping on the blades (chopping on the blades)
I'm always trying to put in work
Niggaz wanna do my dirt
Balling down on Beale Street
Sipping on a pint of syrup
Chopping up the chronic weed
Picking all the fucking seeds
Trying to slow my roll
In my trunk I got them fucking keys
Always riding Chevy things
Shining on them twanky things
Kids I'm a role model
Police I'm a dope man
Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead
Never has it left my mouth
Optimos a fifth of crown
Red eyes with a frown
Niggaz with them gold teeth
Fast talking on the town
Some of us are under cover
Make your baby mama love us
Knot in my right pocket
Left pocket got them rubbers
Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash
I'mma go pimp a bitch
I'mma like wicked witch
Always got to watch your friends
Backstabbers cause a snitch
Now see let me blow your mind the real business in the wind
The main thing fucking up these hoes is their fucking friends
You remember back in day it was niggaz pimping hoes
Take a look around now it be hoes pimping hoes
What the business what the deal man these hoes got me fucked
Make me walk up in the strip and kind of get like buck
Oh you fucking with my cheese oh you fucking with my paper
Bitch you got to pay the piper even if you straight rape her
I ain't mad about my girl licking pussy with a girl
Cause she got to get it done but that thing ain't my world
Bitch I'll tell you what your job and your job nonstop
I need the spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch

On knees and Bentley's, mozzarella cheese

I don't wanna go back to that hell
Rather be dead than doin life in a jail cell
Die young oh well (well) I had a good life (life)
They rappin 'bout it but I'm out here payin the price
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
I wake up out of bed, right after the crack of dawn and
I give myself a - stretch up, a morning yawn and
See I'm a pawn in this neighborhood chess game
Move one step at a time, long as the Lord bless me (f'real)
I know the rest aim high, I'm tryin to aim it higher (higher)
Watchin the lames aspire (aspire) to street success mayne (mayne)
They tryin to blame the fire (fire) but that's like wettin water (water)
You either burnt or washed out, so get in order (order)
Everyday it's gettin harder to fuck with the flow
I'm tryin to keep, all of my motherfuckin ducks in a row (row)
I gotta see a man 'bout a dog and sell him a cat
If you don't know, then you don't know, dat's dat
Shit a dollar outta fifteen cents, I got a dime
Tryin to hustle up my way to a million, I gotta grind (gotta grind)
Walkin the line like cash, I'm on my mash
Two hundred yards behind in a hundred yard dash
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Lord I'm sittin here on bended knee, my hands locked, eyes shut
Askin you to watch over me, no matter what
Even though I ain't too well behaved, I'm still a child of you
And faith in my Holy Father is all that keep me smilin through
The bad times and worse times, through it all
When my head is hangin low, you help me to stand tall
The only way I'm a ball, the only way I'm a shine
Is if you lookin after me while I'm out here on the grind
[Pimp C:]
UNGGHH~! I know you bless the child that go get it
I'm the product of the ghetto, the flame of the city
So I talk the language of the ave
Forgive my dirty mouth please, I'm whippin slabs
Fifties, quarters and the whole thangs
Balance on my life on the fo' beam
And I need codeine just to say sane
I'm steady prayin to you but I don't know your real name
Knahmtalkinbout!
But I'm under the impression that if your heart is in the right place
Your prayers gon' get heard anyway
So some say Jah Jah, some say Allah
Some say Jesus, some say... Yeshua Ben'ta, knahmalkinbout
Ay man I just look like this man, knahmtalkinbout
I ain't get this far bein no square man
You wanna hide some'n from black folks, they say you can put it in a book
I don't believe that
Cause I done read fo' libraries worth of books
I got some knowledge y'all need to get up on mayne
But hold a pair of hearts, knahmtalkinbout
For they laws and power, knahmsayin the art of war
The secret societies of America, knahmtalkinbout
Everythang ain't what it look like man
And don't judge every book by it's cover... ya dig!
Hold up

<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Gawd-DAYUM! I don't know what y'all been thinkin bout
But I think this right here is about to shut dem damn haters down!
I'm from the streets that make niggaz walk slow talk low
With white chalk-o, mi casa be siete uno ocho
Brooklyn motherfucker, handle this - pardon my Spanish and French (Brooklyn baby!)
Okay, I stay clever like Mayweather with lay leather
'til your face sever, one of the greatest ever
Beyond ringing bells, my name's so demanding
Shit! - I got the swagger that'll leave Dakota "Fanning" (That boy still standing!)
I hope you niggaz over standing; I stay sucker-free
The next kaing of in the game, you ain't got enough to be
Your career last a week, that'll be luckily
Fuck with me, the rap game'll need protective custody
(AHH!) I'm the same thug to be, surrounded with women
Gave the game "True Religion" before you found it in denim
Feel the, "Wrath of Kane, " and you could not escape
The hip-hop version of "The Ring" and you just watched the tape (Next up!)
And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We Trill workin the wheel, understand nigga? (UNDERSTAND?)
I smother and split a bitch down to the tendon
High pressure, if you don't break your ass bendin
I'm way past endin in my series of warnin
You flex with me tonight playa you dead by the mornin (Woo!)
Bun Beater the best ever breathin or deceased
From the South to Midwest, Cali to the East
Got to any city nigga and bring my name up (all o'em!)
I bet I eat the best rapper they got in the game up
Call a nigga up, email him or chirp him
Make a meal out his motherfuckin ass and then burp him
(DAYUM!) Don't fuck around I'm not your lil' homey
I'm the king of the underground so act like you know me (Next up!)
Feel me...
Homie, we big steppin, big reppin
We givin kids Smith & Wesson's lessons, you get left with a sketchin
Left with the Midwest, clique Texans (who dat?)
G. and Daddy Kane, the click Texas, (word) pop you to death
I put private planes on swift Jetsons, niggaz know what it is
When you see the ball cap and a slick Thessons (woo!)
(Aight) Til you strip vexing to a movie clip from the Westerns
Shit from the Uzi clip lift up your midsection (Tell em G. Rap)
He will introduce you to the nose on the Glock fam
Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band (rock band!)
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man (AOOOW!)
High roller dose some hoes on the cock plan
Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin cheese til the rubberbands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em "Hot Pants" (Next up!)
I make your girl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt
I'm a young hot street flame (Flame)
They call me Sweet James, or call me Sir Jones
Two hundred dollar cologne
(Uh!) Board Nine, or Issey Miyaki
I got your girl mine, meat strong like saki
I ain't Rocky but I keep her rockin
Fuck around I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket
Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin watchin my top fall in
On my Lambourghini with the quick scream
Fettucini, linguini, shrimp and a bowl of lean!
What you know about gettin cross country
Nigga your piece big but your diamond look monkey
You need to take that shit back
That ain't no emmy diamonds what the fuck you done to that...

Now, damn somebody need to beat Jacob's ass over that!

Well, well, I know, I know, I know, yeah
Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin' crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper I gotta do it quick
Thinkin' I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin' wit, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live everyday like it's my muthafuckin' last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'ma die
But if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'ma take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say, "It'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
This world we livin' in man it ain't nuthin' but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya in New York niggas gettin' shot fo bombers
Now they got yo life in the former they in like California
Niggas wit dubs are hydroponic, marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pops died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wished it was twice mayn
I remember bein' eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not givin' a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' to the end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen fo damn near ten
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day you here but the next day you gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
I'm up early 'cuz ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets Peanut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin' shife, so shife back
Can't show no weakness wit these bitches life jacked
Mayn it's a trip where I stay especially for me
Them bitches tryin' to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga down in Florida Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I ain't no liar
My man BoBo jus' lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God why he let these killas live
And take my homeboy's son away
Man if you got kids show 'em you love 'em
'Cuz God jus might call 'em home
'Cuz one day you're here, the next day you're gone
I know, you know, well, well, yeah
La ra la ra, I know, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you're gone
One day you're here, come on

Back, bitch (uh)...Kool Ace (whuut), UGK...(huh)
[Chorus: Pimp C]
Pimpin' ain't no illusion,
And pimpin' ain't never died.
Mo' pimps was on that heroin
And yo' pimp tripped out on that fry.
The dikes done came through
And straight threw off all the game;
Got all these hoes thinkin'
They could manage they own change.
[Kool Ace:]
But it ain't no illusion,
I know... you all have witnessed
He rollin' in my Caady mo'
Wit' fly bitches,
Makin' ole deals: Now, ho (huh, huh)
Ain't Bob Barker
But I'm caught up in this game
Mo' like... Peter Parker.
P-I-M-P, take the P's that I am.
I want you payin' hoes in my army
Like... uh... Uncle Sam,
And we gon' jam...
I'm talkin' 'bout the world greatest show
I know my shit is extreme
But I'm all about them does.
When I'm steppin' on the scene
Be there four deep... hella clan
My reality is your favorite dream
(Stop that shit, daddy...)
Best believe Kool Ace gon' keep it real.
Pimp C & Bun B to testify for the ear
Excuse me, y'all, but this about Southern shit.
Now, tell me can you... uh... feel this, bitch?
We givin' 'em brain contusions...
Pimp C, what's the conclusion?
[Pimp C:]
Pimpin' ain't no illusion...
[Chorus: x2]
[Pimp C:]
Pimpin' ain't dead... nigga, it just began
(How the fuck you know Sweet Jones?)
My hoes still out there sellin' ass.
Yo' bitch is out of pocket,
'Cause yo' pimpin' was scary;
Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy.
Fuck niggas watch them mack and pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what y'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'.
This is the conclusion: pimpin' ain't no illusion.
[Chorus: x2]
Bun B:
If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her,
'Cause a beggar ain't a muthafuckin' chooser.
Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean.
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a wif a this...
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior... and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny... sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again... that's why...
[Chorus: x2]
Too $hort:
You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money... it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game.
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it.
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin'...beeyatch.

<SONGSTART>So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F**k it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
Sweet jones
By bitch a choosey lover, never f**k without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like the f**k for 40 dollars in the club
f**king up the game, bitch you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
Because its greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real streets stalker to walk a green mile
We burnin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
Im a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B U N B
Cause whats a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoes
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get jones
OOOooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
Eni mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl dont touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-saw pole
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers gettin sloppy
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D b**** is getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
Dump dump in the gut, walk it off from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kitties up
Ooooohhhhh Ooooooohhh
I chose you girl
IIIIiiii
I chose you baby
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

Life is a pussy motherfucker, I'm gon' get me some
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane (plane)

It's a new world order, at least that's what I read (read)
And big brother is watchin, I just heard somebody said
Jesus was married to Mary (Mary) and they both had a kid (kid)
And it's a piece of history that the Catholic church hid (hid)

We don't trust, we don't pass, we just touch people
We hit 'em three times, ain't lyin/line like Adidas
Surrounded by killers and dealers and club geekers
Summertime, Dapper Dan, candy ridin coupes
Wintertime, snow suits with the Louie boots
See the purse came first, the love came later
The pussy got wet and captain D came greater
I do it for the Bun and I do it for the Pimp
For the hustlers and the gangstas doin' time behind the fence
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART><SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Uh, it's really goin' down in the South bitch
Yeah nigga, we know hip hop and rap
And all that shit started in the motherfuckin' East
Know I'm sayin'? Then it went to the West coast
And they did it a little bit better
Know I'm sayin'? But now it's our time
To shine down here nigga
Know I'm sayin'? So since y'all niggaz keep sayin'
We ain't real hip hop down here
We don't wanna be down with you bitch ass niggaz
So y'all stay up there with that bullshit
This country rap tunes down here nigga
Young Pimp, Young Bun, Underground Kingz
All the O.G.'s that's recognizin' the real
I got love for y'all but all you bitch ass niggaz
Talkin' down in ya records, you can eat a dick
Hold up
Pushin' cocaine, servin' pounds of weed
Steady stayin' on the grind
Pussy nigga can't say he ain't hatin' me
Because if you did, then you wouldn't be lyin'
But how in the hell am I supposed to respect the man?
That talk down on every song
You steady actin' like a bitch, you steady cryin' your eyes out
Say my name pussy nigga, we can get the shit on, on, ooh yeah
Quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, gettin' money
Quit hatin' the South, baby
Quit hatin' the South
Well, it's been a long time my nigga, I shouldn't have left you
When I some real trill shit to go left to
Gotta lot of respect fool, for the ones before me
But when my time came they act like they ain't know me
I've been down with rap music since Cold Crush and Melle
Before MTV put Run-D.M.C. on the tele
Back when Whodini tried to tell ya about ya friends
Nigga I was givin' rap all my time and my ends
Bought damn near every record the motherfucker dropped
West coast gangsta music, East coast hip hop
Now it's our time to shine and the tables is turned
Them motherfuckers aggravated 'cause we gettin' some burn
There's no room for everybody, just a few niggaz is swole
Probably 'cause they favorite rappers ain't in control
But just let go of the past 'cause it's hurtin' your hands
And pass it over to the next generation of fans
And quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, getting' money
Quit hatin' the South, baby
Quit hatin' the South
I'm blastin' off on you hoes like NASA
You double standards and hypocrisy remind me of Massa
We ain't good enough to eat at ya table but when ya dick get hard
You wanna run up with I from the get coke but I'm still clockin' figures
Bitch hoe cock suckin' nigga
And that goes for all you visitors too
If you don't like it down here, get the fuck on fool
They say you can't rap and they questionin' our intellect
Friendly ass niggaz jumpin' bad on the Internet
Ain't nobody typin' that much can't be a danger
Catch you in person, bitch I'll break yo' fingers
It's some trash in the South but I promise you
From the East to the West, some of y'all garbage too
As long as the beat knock and the lyrics hot, son
I can give a rat's ass where a rap is from
I remember N.W.A. and PE
Had me feelin' like a rapper was the thing to be
You can't fuck with Willie D, UGK either
Disrespectin' the code, does motherfuckers neither
Quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, gettin' money
To all the radio, TV and even the press
Been hatin' on the Sizz-outh like we ain't impress
Y'all think we came in the place, say man we came in the state
Y'all shoulda listened to Andre, bitch we got somethin' to say
And all you washed up rappers, you ain't what it's about
I see y'all tryin' rap like us and puttin' grills in ya mouth
Y'all buy the beat, buy the beat like y'all bouncin' and twerkin'
But hoe we know what's goin' on and bitch that bullshit ain't workin'
I'ma O.G. Rock Ball, write my name up on the wall
Fuck yo' bitch and hit the switch and put my dick up in her jaw
I'm Sweet Jones, fucked a clone, legend on the microphone
Player's choice, silver Royce, keep yo' bitch's pussy moist
I'm bumped the school, that's how I do, sippin' drank, each teen night
In Benz, big blue lens, knock this bitch and fuck with her friend
Candy cart, squeeze 'em out, bought the ranch man fuck the house
And y'all still gotta buy y'all dope from us
So what the fuck you bitch niggaz talkin' 'bout?
All you ole sensitive ass niggaz, know I'm talkin' 'bout?
Y'all niggaz on y'all period up there bitch
Know I'm talkin' 'bout? Y'all hide behind them e-mail addresses
Sendin' that bullshit through the air
Bitch, say my name bitch, I'ma come to ya house
Fuck how you feel, country rap tunes nigga
They put all y'all records on one side of the store
And put all the country rap music on the other side of the store
And see who sell out first
Bitch ass nigga, it's ya own fault ya shit ain't sellin'
You reap what you sew and fuck you in ya pussy
Keep talkin' that shit
Them young gladiators go come get you too partner
Already, UGK for life, fuck how you feel about it bitch

So what the fuck is up?

Ease up my muthafuckin' cut
'Cause if you don't really wanna fuck wit a trill nigga
From the trill villa wit a steel trigga land of the real killers
Pop pop muthafucka there you go
I'ma bust 'em on yo ass if you don't ease up off me ho
'Cause trill niggas don't carry no sugar in they nutsac
Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack
So you gon' give me my money but you don't hear me though
But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes
P.A. nigga, trill ass nigga
How you figga you can buck me down nigga?
Mr. big an, Mr. big time, give me what's mine
Instead of buying cars for a bitch named sunshine
Give me what's mine, give me what's mine
Before it come down to triggas
Shit, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Bitch, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Uh, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
But you can't hear me
It's the return of the trill ass niggas bitch
Yea muthfuckas, I figured you run
I figured you run, when I pull triggas to guns
That triggas to guns P.A. fool a nigga named Bun
A nigga named Bun, no more sun, no more shine
Say hello to the nine milly millameter
(Buck, buck, buck)
Money tight glock, bustin' them shots
When I break yo ass off somethin' hot
Niggas steady catchin' lead to the head
I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin' bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin', niggas start passin' away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise, I'm gettin' Chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now it's the return of the trill ass niggas

<SONGSTART>Ridin' dirty, straight up dedicated to the Cadillacs
I'm ridin' dirty, know what I'm sayin'?
Comin' down on the slab, boy
Ridin' dirty, for real tho, ridin' dirty
Have you ever been rollin' in a clean ass 'Lac
Blowin' big out the window, everybody got a sack
Got my heat right between my seat, got a box of them thangs
In case these fools start playin' with me
You'd be surprised how them boppers wink, girl, I can't stop
Give my headlights a blink and roll them up out the top
And keep movin' and keep rollin'
Fools that don't be holdin' I'm comin' through and foldin'
And I can't stand snitches, wanna kill all of y'all
Even though some bustas fall I'm still rollin' like a ball
And having things my way, hittin' that highway
Sellin' that big yay, a plush-ass place to stay
Police, they wanna run in
Talkin' on cell phones got a lotta kids done in
I wanna live like Arnold, Willis and Mr. Drummond
And keep my paper sturdy, big birds and tight herbs
Fool, I'm ridin' dirty
Big birds and tight herbs, fool I'm ridin' dirty
Ridin' dirty, fool, ridin' dirty
Tell me can you feel it? Man, nothin' can save ya
I believe it's that season for gettin' yo papers
Or haven't you heard about them birds? We call it that cheese
In Texas we get it with ease, hit I-10 if you please
But these polices, they think they sharp as creases
For no reasons, man, they straight up strippin' cars to pieces
Out of suspicion or if they thinkin' you on a mission
Ain't no wishin' or prayin', they sayin' assume the position
Hands behind ya head, down on ya knees
You get the case and they get yo weight and yo G's
Come on, I use to ride the Port Arthur city streets
With a chick with pretty feets and a box of Philly Sweets
They tried to finish me but couldn't get it done
So somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty
Man, somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty
Sup PA, uh, what, ridin' dirty
Beamount, yeah, uh, man, ridin' dirty
Uh, ridin' dirty, uh, ridin' dirty

<SONGSTART>[Intro: Pimp C]
UHH...
Dedicated to all the underdogs, knahmtalkinbout?
Muthafuckas told me I wasn't gon be shit...
Told me I was gon be able to do this rap shit...
Knahmtalkinbout? My own family talked down on me, knahmsayin?
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (My uncle told me I wasn't gon be shit)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (I used to walk around with a bag full of rappers)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
(Motherfucker told me, a nigga from Texas couldn't make no record)
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
(Then after I made the record, muh'fuckers said they would never give us no respect)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... (But now they tryna rap like us)
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah... (Tryna be like us, tryna smell like us)
(Knahmtalkinbout?)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money... (Check this out)
[Pimp C:]
Man I refuse to let the bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up, but they cain't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a hoe open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a hoe for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
(right... right...)
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (hmm...)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (hmm...)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho...
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money...
[Pimp C:]
To all the babies havin babies on ya' own
I know you feelin fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, "Ya fucked up your life"
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy with lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggaz tellin you, "Ya crazy"
"What you thankin? You too young to have a family"
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggaz ain't gon ride witchu
But get down with that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin
It's time to change sumthin...
[Chorus]
[Pimp C:]
If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, "It ain't enough room in the NBA"
You tell them haters, "Save that bullshit for another day"
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, "You ain't gon make it", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase to hog it up, the lawyer end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be shame and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right...
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
... (Uh!)

Trying to fit my whole dick and nuts inside your mouth
I'm jumping in and out, your pussy trying to stretch it out
When I hit you from the back you say don't pull it out
And that nigga that you live with ain't like me
Ain't from Atlanta but I know these hoes like me
They pulling on my zipper wanna bite me
I got a bitch from Oakland like to get hyphe
In the bed with her head in a jib
Eating on my dick like it's some corn or a barbeque rib
Drop it to the floor, let me fuck with you
Get the camera out, bitch, I'm finna take some pictures
I make her get down on a dime, open up the store
Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor

She's a big fine something ain't she, with that big ass
Bet you she can grind something can't she, she shake it fast
Shake it slow, to and fro, back and forth, up and down
That apple bottom clowning it ain't fucking around
, been kinda tight
Real stuck on that backside, it's looking kind of right
With the juicy tank top and a loop of ten heels
All bullshit aside, she looking ready to kill
But when I say kill, I mean murder the cock
I'm talking beating the pussy up while the headboards knock
She ain't watching the clock, ain't finna answer the phone
'Cause Bun Beata got that dick that put your cheek in a zone
I make her get down on a dime, open up the store
Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor
(And she luv it)
Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor

Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor

Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor
These hoes loving the living, I'm giving all they can take
These hoes living for loving, I'm shoving dick til' they break
Put your feet in the sky, bring your knees to your chest
Grab a hold to the sheets, bitch, and I'ma do the rest
Get to pressing on your pink, gripping on your soft
To the side, take a ride, from the back I break you off
I want some pussy and some navel and some ass and some mouth
I ain't fucking for me bitch, I'm fucking for the whole south
Show me what you working with, bitch, what you got?
I really wanted to fuck but hoe you went and shaved your cock
A bald head pussy ain't shit, got them razor bumps bitch
Grow some hair and get legit

<SONGSTART>Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S H O R T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be living naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell
I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fucking maker
'Cause I ain't taking, no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts
Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch
This dope ain't yo dope and these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafucking guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafucking road
And don't even try to come back nigga, yo
'Cause me Dre and C got fingers on a fat trigger
We making too much money moving weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper booming cold blow yo ass up
And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailing on yo bitch ass
But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas
Niggaz on the track dropping shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cooking up some llello for the local drug king
The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slanging some more white dust
Real, oh, so trill, the life's no glamor
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fucking up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home
And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales
Stupid muthafuckas smoking dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fighting Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops finding my stash, yo what could the worst be
Through so going undercover then turning dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Calling my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas
I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't 'bout to sell no fucking dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope but you still ain't selling shit
Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon' let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafucking cuts
So step in like I said before, we'll take them muthafucking nuts
Ask the last nigga brought his fucking ass down
Trying to sell that fucking dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'm a go to Port Arthur and run them fucking niggaz
Brought his fucking gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac
Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope
Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
'Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafucking killas
So have your shit attached, before you come check us
Pimp C, bitch, P.A. home, Short Texas
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>[Pimp C:]
One with a trigger, two with a bat
Three big brothers, fo' - wanna squab with me
So I guess a brother gotta throw
Tell 'em like this, ya better get up out my camp dude
Befo' I have to pull my gat and get, real rude
I don't figure that it's worth gettin hurt
Just 'cause ya gal wanna give me that skirt
Bet it feels funny when ya doin 69
Knowin that ya sippin on all my jimmy wine
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bad
Knowin that ya swallowed all the skeeter that I had?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda shot you up instead I told ya somethin good
[Chorus: sampled from Chaka Khan & Rufus' "Something Good"]
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah... yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
[Bun B:]
Aiyyo, what's up with that bulge in ya khakis?
You wanna pack a gat, but you STILL ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gangload of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cause by yourself, you're runnin to the flo'
I seen your kind befo', man ya nothin with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin when ya chillin with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin up some daisies
See crazy you wanna be, but punks with no heart, they ain't hard
They just waitin for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep your weak self locked in ya hood
Cause without your boys I'm a have to tell ya somethin good
[Chorus]
(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)
[Pimp C:]
Brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check ya girl and what she did in the past
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her REAL fast
But I don't trust the dugout, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check ya blood and let somebody check your teeth
But if you don't step, I'm a drop on ya fast
And pump off bullets like government cash
I didn't do ya girl but your sister was alright
Took her to my homeboy's Caddy last night [girl moaning in the background]
She waxed my jimmy, and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit if from the back, and the girl just THREW ME
Told me, "Pump it harder, " and she scratched me on my BOOTY
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty lil' girl
[Chorus 1/2]
[Bun B:]
Let's talk about these half-n-half punks
By day they sorry bastards, at night they talkin bout, poppin trunks
Butter .25 cain't keep you alive
From a sawed-off, fool so I hope you survive
See bluffin might save ya tail one day
But who's ta say, it won't catch ya next week, on the runway?
You might shoot a few shots in the wind
But the same time tomorrow, you'll be runnin again
Now can you keep it up, every damn night?
You steady runnin to the argument but runnin from the fight
What's the deal man? Why don't you take your Raiders cap off?
Cause one of these days, you gonna getcha head slapped off
You cain't keep a crew cause they gettin sick of seein you bail
Like a punk'll hit the backstreet trail
And the women don't like you cause ya act like them
And that's why your little jimmy never went fo' a swim
Ya talk about slangin, makin G's
But I saw a fiend chase ya from, BJ's up to Mickey D's
Now everyday punks get took
Either for they dough, they'll ride 'em for the powder that they cook
You bookin from the scene cause ya couldn't hold ya own
A 40 ounce bottle slams, ya dead to your dome
Now you want revenge, so ya get your automatic
Find a group of hard-heads, and startin kickin static
Ya pulled ya little chrome but these fools got gats
Try to run and caught two buckshots in ya back
Now you nothin but a memory that's gone in a slayin
So when I tell you somethin good, punk I don't be playin

No time to eat or sleep im slangin' licks and that just won't wait
Im campaignin for a new Benz
On the rims with bubble lenz
Im stackin' every dollar i see 100s 50s 20s and 10s
Doors open doors close never sweat hoes playas get yo's
Hustle and flow cars clothes thats the playa like that i know
Roll the dank up where the dro?
Pour the drank up where the fo's
Stackin money all on the low and we still ridin dirty
Got a drop top on them rollerskates
Candy jolly rancher paint
Enjoyin the spoils of hard work and grind more tryin to get bank
I dont know what them boys thinkin my motivation is benjamin franklin
Im tryin to maintain this wealth that i been calculatin
Gettin money thats all i know
On my toes never off my note
Woodgrain and hundred spokes i wave the trunk just like a pro
I grind its off to work i go I hustle hard its no stop
And if i flop i switch to hustle
I learned the game then set up shop
Im strivin' to make it to the top
Its all or nothin no turnin back
Im with them boys out on the block
Accumulating them paper stacks
Im makin money this where its at
Whatever it takes crack or jack
In love with my money and thats a fact
And we STILL RIDIN' DIRTY
Right now we got the 5th wheel reclinin
Trunk popped up screens fallin from the sky
Candy paint sprayed by eddie and im ridin on that glassy chrome
all courtesy of my hustle game
Real hustlin's in my blood line
I dont complain or whine
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make
a dime I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind but now i see that road to riches
Its a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs
I peep game from the best and since then i been playin chess
I put in work with no rest
To get that paper thats my quest
Im on the slow grind towards success
One of the best 'cause i keep it fresh
Im one hundred isnt nothin less
And im STILL RIDIN' DIRTY

Please rise for the president of the south and all hale to the cheif with them diamond teeth in his mouth
Make way! Big Dick Chaney is bout to enter
king committees in session but first on the agenda
Bend the corner on them fours lac turnin on them vouges
1 time for the haters, 2 times for the hoes
I suppose its only right for me to grip up on the cherry, oak wood wheel while im drippin cranberry
and very few have acomplished what we have acheived without a rabbit out of a hat or a trick up his sleeve
I got a steady hand and a steady flow so, on your mark get set, ready go, you already know...
(Chorus: Jazze Pha)
We be pullin up in the hot shit and thats cuz we the stars of the show

Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
You know Bun B the business street soulja in the trenches
Frontline comin' down on twenty four inches
Dope boys hangin' on the corners and the benches
Sayin' it's a drout so it's plenty of heat pinches
Boy, used to come up from the rags to the riches
Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches
But now it's like the game is full of nothin' but some snitches
And wanna be gangsters that's scared to put 'em in ditches
Fed's takin' pictures so the cameras go click
And video rollin' while I'm holdin' my dick
They follow me around like they doin' they job
But while you watchin' me how many people gettin' robbed
Lets keep it trill 'cause we already know
What it already is and how it already go
That's why we chop blades comin' down real slow
Pop trunks, swang, riders slam Cadillac door
Pass the swisha let's blow
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Before we get started, every body roll up one for Pimp C
Before we go any further, take your lighter, light it up for me
Now let's go, now let's go and all the girls get down on the floor
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
I'm whippin' big wheels, whippin' big wheels
Hope your drink don't spill whippin' big wheels
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel
lady on my side, hey
And if you all down for me
Put your hands in the air raise 'em up for Pimp C
And if you all down with me
Put your hands in the air raise 'em up for Pimp C
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb

A little sly delight, I done pushed my pride aside
Just to slide inside, man I done died tonight
Now what I'm 'sposed to do? Been got close to you
Lookin like a poster to, don't wanna boast but you Missus
Do a Dr. Feel good, lay a playa real good
Limpin came back, and it was still good, she will
Put a few tips in her mouth, that's that definition
Of them true chicks in the South, let me do my thang
On the cool quick to the crotch, get the beds but guess what?

And if I skip I'm back to D-slangin, keep them boys nod-headed
Keep the boppers with they butts swangin

Swangin' through yo' hood, diamonds on the wheel

Some niggaz be winnin' and some be steady losin'
Touchin' down, women they stayin', they steady chosin'

The product of the product and the cousin of crime
So get that fuck up out your mind, I'm born to this life
And my work is the only woman I'll ever make my wife
So all you triflin'-ass, stiflin'-ass, mud-stuck, fuck boys
Gettin' bound to borin', you shit out of luck boys
The Kingz is back in the buildin', just in the knick of time
And we fin' to do it to it partner while you niggaz lyin'
Touchin' us, you niggaz dyin', kill you hoes, just for tryin'
Death befo' dishonor, you never see me testifyin'
Standin' on the stand, grab a workout in the yard
Trill niggaz never fraud, you can put that on the Lord
Goin' hard, ask the hardest nigga you know in the street

Ain't no candy paint wetter, no 24's classier
No leather seats softer, no other brothers classier
And you could never pass me up, so slow your roll, mayne
Recognize the real when Pimp and Bun in control, mayne
Ugh, I got a candy cup, sittin' on buck
Two-hundred thousand when I roll up
Year ago, I was on lock, now I'm out here droppin' them tops
48 months, I was gone, barely got back, it's still on
I know y'all hate to see the Pimp free, all y'all all can eat a big D
I see the Kingz winnin', thought it was over, it's the beginnin'
Underground, we run the South, diss me, I'ma bust your mouth

You gon' lose, nigga, that's no doubt

It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital
Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that
There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?"
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'

Don't know where you been bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though
When it's ten fo', good, but in my Styrofoam good and muddy
We block bleeders, leavin' your neighborhoods good and bloody
We grippin' that woodler, bud it, sit back and scope it
Pay attention to Prince and pushin' everything about to pump it

A Phantom Rolls Royce, 24's with the bump
I ain't trippin' about the seat, I got them woofers in my trunk
Cut in my swisher, codeine on my whiskers
Fuckin' with that Smoke D, Bundy and that Vicious
UGK Records, it's an institution
Know a lot of niggaz livin' off of prostitution
Pimpin' ain't dead, it just moved to the web
Bitch ain't gotta hit the track, ain't gotta give no tricks no head
Ain't got to give no tricks, no pussy, just cameras and screams
Easiest money you can get, it's the American Dream bitch
Man I'm a middle finger figure, a million dollar mission
Poppin' like Orville Redenbacher, with a whippin' in the kitchen
Yayo like Dontrelle Willis, we the trillest on the mound
I'm holdin' that whole South down, I know you feel us
We the realest walkin' the planet
Can't stand it, pass away, wanna fight us
Start to swingin', wanna kill us, blast away, wanna stab us
Get to stickin but make sure you cut us deep
'Cause I betcha we comin' back a couple hundred brothers deep
Pimp and Bun, we run the streets, which streets? Man, pick your hood
Don't matter, we represented, cross us? We gon' get you good
Them Down South veterans, ain't nobody better than
Gonna tell your next of kin or your brethren, let us in cousin

Her lips, hit my dick that's why I smashed on the throttle
Swisha Sweet candy, Robert Davis in my cup

They both for me now watch them girls get buck (buck)
Ain't shit friendly but we still have fun (fun)
UGK for life, you know the Pimp and the Bun (Bun)
The great state of Texas, candy in the Lexus
Dick for them hoes jaws, pistols for the flexers
Somebody asked me why I'm ridin on the East
All I did was told the truth, the bullshit niggaz cease (cease)
If you ain't hatin nigga why the fuck you mad?
If your records ain't sellin, get your fingers out ya ass, bitch!

Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing

Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your Colby Jet system (no)

Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang

<SONGSTART>Listen up, I got a story to tell
Hey, fool, listen up, I got a story to tell
Say, dawg, listen up, I got a story to tell
Say, man, listen up, I got this story to tell on the cool
Now, once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga, like myself had to strong arm a ho
Now, this was not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no God damn sense, tryin' to push me
He used to hold dick, now he wanna be in my shoes
Hatin' like a baby, mama 'cause I'm payin' my dues
Tryin' to hold on to my little chunk but now but a punk
In the parkin' lot bumpin' his gums with his teeth in the trunk
Oh, what? I'm supposed to jump 'cause you got a pump
You aimin' that bitch in the sky, you chump
Point that muthafuckah this way and dump, oh, what?
You scared to go to the pen? Thinkin' them niggas gon' tap yo' rump
Man, I thought he played bold, be he ain't even fuss
Man, the nigga was way swole actin' like he wanted to bus'
But his trigger stayed cold, I wasn't surprised
I recognized that fast breathin' and fear in his eyes
Unmask his disguise, a sheep in wolf's clothing on the prey
He tried to hunt the hunter, and got hunted down his God damn self
In PA, niggas, it's where we stay, ain't none of that K-K-K'n or playin'
So see A or E up out your life or you test yourself
And make a nigga break you off to piece the rest yo'self
Oh, yes yo' health is what's in question and I hope
That this ass whoopin', teach you a motherfuckin' lesson.
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
'Cause deep down in the South, boy's comin' up cold
Talkin' down my name and what it's all about, you niggas
Better get some cut and get my name out yo' mouth
'Cause I don't know why you got flex with me, testin' me
But, I'ma pull my shit and let you see that all that carry the jack
Ain't what it's about, so you haters need to quit with that po'
Hustlin' and take another ride
Niggas, often crossed the line, the movies got this boy fucked
Up in the mind, not to mention the wine and codeine syrup
Combined easy access to 9's and shit talkin' hoes that's fine
And all they got time for is four Swisher dimes, committing crimes
Amped off water and some exaggerated rhyme, so, if bein' hard
Ain't in your heart, then don't start, niggas'll tear your weak mind apart
Bitch, your old man talkin' to me like I'm in school, he don't know
I hang with killers, will erase that fool, wouldn't give a fuck about him
But he kin to my son if you think I'm that nigga, then you picked
The wrong one, 'cause I live by the gun, die by the gun, hot bullets burn
Some say that, "Them bitches stun", so raise yo' own children
Don't try to raise mine and when you see me, step with caution
'Cause I'm buckin' for mine, bitch.
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You done crossed the line, now you gon' get fucked
I already told you before, but you ain't borrowing that
So, this time I'm handlin' mine and gon' erase you off the map
Such a shame but this all in the game and since the early sixties
Ain't a damn thang changed, we got haters over here
And haters over there but, I got my pistol and it ain't pointed in the air
I see you trippin' off that water, and you feel like you bad
'Cause yo' bitch done chose a pimp, and that pimp was Chad
I see you hurt 'cause I fucked yo' girl, put big dick in her world
Bust nuts in her curl, when I hit it from the back, she said
"Baby, I can't take it", push my dick up in her harder
Bitch, I'm straight up tryin' to break it, you a simp-ass nigga
You told that bitch, that, "You love her", but I'm straight up fuckin'
That pussy like that nigga off that colors but I ain't gon' get shot
'Cause you ain't shootin' shit, the best thing you can do is go and try
And beat that bitch, 'cause this man's style show stopper
Pistol popper, you ain't ready if I let this hot thing hit you
Feel your stomach like spaghetti, fool, you talkin' loud
But you move too slow, tellin' niggas all your plans
Got you tied up in a van, nigga, what the fuck is up in the place to be
First, I want the money, nigga, then I want the fuckin' ki's
Kidnap robbery 'cause you said you wanted me dead
Since you want a nigger dead, buck that bitch off in his head
Just like E-40, nigga, I be comin' bad, got the sawed-off pump
With night vision, infrared, so, play me like a pussy
And you will get fucked, nigga, I'm hangin' out the truck
Buck, buck, buck, hit your nigga in the leg, hit yo' bitch in the gut
But we know where your ass stay, so your ass will get touched
Speaked the wrong words I'm high on them herbs
And you will get touched because yo' ass deserve
To get done real fast in front of yo' kids to show 'em
What real type of bitch you is and it's that boy named
Three to the two, forever stayin' true just a player makin' due
And I gotta tell it to the whole wide world, how you got bitched
Razor neck just like a motherfuckin' girl, little muthafuckin' girl

Pussy nigga, I pack that nine everytime and I ain't trying dying
I just wanna celebrate
Cause trill niggaz don't die
Pussy nigga, thinking you gon kill me
I got some'ing for your ass, nigga you gon feel me
I'ma blow you out the water, with the 2-23
Putting dick up in your daughter, rap is over I serve some cheese
Nigga talking bout, robbing Chad
Run up on me with that first, will leave you stinking in the grass
If your calico to mask, if you Baptist go to church
See a hoe up in a nigga, gon pull up a skirt
That'll be, some incredible shit
Niggaz scheming on my bezel, on some devilish shit
I been to hell and back, on another level you bitch
Go on try it I'm going live, they gon need a shovel for you bitch
I been stabbed I been shot, went from no fans to being hot
But somehow always fall short, for trying to keep fiddles in my pot
In a dog eat dog world, y'all fellas be chasing girls
When I place myself in history, too hot for a ladder to catch me
But I can't help but to notice, I'm one of the coldest
And I know y'all haters love when I'm locked up, but I won't lose focus
Yeah I wrote this counting down, how many days I got
So lately my gun ain't been hid, it's been displayed a lot
My attitude is fucked up, I don't give a fuck cause I just don't give one
Thinking bout living a life where everything you do right is wrong, mo'fucker I live one
I know niggaz wanna kill me, but I'm still riding pride
Cause the Lord riding with me, and that's the main reason why
Some niggaz win, and some niggaz lose
Some niggaz getting bruised, some always crying to blues
Some niggaz already lost, and ain't gon lose no mo'
Big shoes hoe choose, ain't paying dues no mo'
Everything y'all trying to do, I built a school hoe
Now it's fly to talk country, I made the rules hoe
I was sagging in my khaki's, 'fore Dickies cool
Gangsta Nike's on my feet, our music banging in the streets
The young B.G.'s, really love to thump
Fuck radio and BET, I'm out here bumping in the trunk
For the girls popping pussy, and the boys with the blow
Cadillac'ers and flat-backers, I'm out here repping for it hoe
Can't any man, boy or woman take away my soul
It's a gift given from God, and I'm keeping a tight hold
The world is ugly and cold, trying to make me the same
But I'ma keep it one hundred, when it come to the game
Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up
We keep it click tight, so when niggaz start lurking
In the dark heaters start, anybody start jerking
Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg
A dragging society, don't borrow don't beg
For tomorrow so gon 'head with your pity, I'ma be cool
Kindergardeners was looking up to me, in pre-school
Down with Pimp C fool, and P-A-T the town
Representing it to the fullest, till I'm gone I hold it down
Bun Beater, would never sell you no lie
So if you ask for the truth, I'ma reply to trill niggaz don't die
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Well it's big Bun Beeda I built the track

Just shake your butts and bring back that stack (stack)
The mack is back and he's sittin on chrome
with a piece of chain or Herringbone or nugget (nugget)
That don't mean him a real live hoe
You ain't ready to roll then go on then, fuck it
Out them ducats, hoes better recognize
Niggaz better recollect, Bun finna regulate

Leave that bitch dry and head to another state (hold up)

Cause we about that cash, cash
So if we can't convince ya we'll take your sister
Hit the highway and mash
You got, bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got, bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got, bitches that can and you got bitches that cain't
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch
Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care
I like the girl with the pussy hair
My partner Mike Mo like the pussy bare
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swang Big Dick, swang Sweet Jones
Go and get the myth out the cobra head
Girl got down you niggaz scared
I got a young yellow bitch, I'ma sing it loud
With a four-inch corner of jet-mink hair
Between her legs is where it great
And get the money out the nigga when she go on a date
I stay caked up, rocked up
Magnum rubbers stay socked up
I ain't tryin to get the wet dick
Hold my good but she ain't that slick
I know you want this high-dollar cum
Bitch know I got money, wanna get her some
Bitch you must, done lost your mind
The trick's niggaz over there, you better get on the grind
Bitches not flexin ain't much good
I should and I would keep clear if I could
But when I do I just CAWN'T get away
Cause I gotta fuck all day every day
That leaves me run loco for real
All these chickenheads lie about deal
Ain't gotta do it up to make me chill
Find a good spot on the floor and kneel!
Know that my heart's in between my fires
Though I can't take when they look in my eyes
Lookin for love that's no surprise
Comin up off, that's family ties
Then I hit it from the back, all the way
Slap that back and just lock cross say
Not freeze out without no delay
Girls in the chat, I ain't got shit to say

Money pimps coming through, so nigga grab your hoes
Trying to sip some'ing too, so nigga pass the purp'
We 'bout to beat your avenue, getting cash and work
It's been a long time, long grind long mash
Now it's long shine, long pine long cash
Tapping ash, out the Cadillac window
While I'm tapping ass, leaning back smoking some endo
Ain't no need to pretend hoe, you know what the real
You know who the truth, when they in the booth you know who the trill
So fuck how you feel, we make you pay by the pound

It was 1984, I heard Run rapping 'bout
Larry Laugh Caddy, wanting to break a bitch cot
22 years later and the block belong to me
Underground Kingz for life, young Pimp C
Put my first record out, at the age of 16
Rapping 'bout moving work, candy painted symphony
We was the first niggaz, talking 'bout wood wheel
Made up the word, that's why I'm so trill
Now everybody, wanna bite my swagger
Roll like a stone, like my name Mick Jagger
Say it befo', had to tell you hoes again
Run a drum machine, like my name Roger Men
Write the rhyme do the beat, the hook and the mix
Records don't sell, I'm back to selling bricks
I went gold, but never sold my soul to bang
And bitch I'll hit you with that thang, I'm a underground kingz
Kingz, kingz
Nigga I risked everythang to be a underground kingz

Cross the line, nigga push my button
And you gon' die in the very spot, that you thought you wasn't
And you gon' look in the eyes of the man
You thought you were better than
T R I double L, that's with capital letters man
The Pimp and the Bun, Bobby U.N. and J.R.
Big Dick Cheney, and Tony Snow you know who they are
We the best than the rest, getting head for the showers
Fucking cowards get out the way, 'cause the rap game's ours
Y'all niggaz, better reco'
That you ain't gotta like me, but you gon' respect me hoe
17 years, I been rapping with that Bun
Fuck the fame want the change, it's been fun
The up's and the down's, the crying and the smiling
Fuck what you heard, UGK is a island
Away from you niggaz, but we still solid land
Sharks swimming in the water, put your nuts in the sand pussy nigga

<SONGSTART>Use me up, I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin' my mind
I'm trippin' and I know it 'cause I'm all nerved up
'Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin' my car
And everyday it get better, I can't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin' she ain't nothin' but a scrub
But she make me feel high like I'm hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I can't help myself, I know that I'm trippin'
But she got it goin' on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my credit card
You know she get it 'cause ya know that
(Chill, C)
I know, G, I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin' pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin' aw'll limp
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and still ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin' good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin' out them duckets and them, croka sacks
And everybody wonderin' why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, ask me why I wanna dis her
I told her 'cause her lovin' ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin' out and Byrd say I'm trippin' too
But this time I just can't listen to my whole crew
'Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But ninety two came around and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
To sum it all up, I'm breakin' all my rules
'Cause she got me droppin' off her little brother to school
I be gettin' bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on sex
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food
UGK sayin' peace out, and plenty of luck
And she could keep usin' Pimp C, uh, just a use me up

Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch, holla at yo' bitch, now yo' bitch on my team
Got her buyin' us sticky green, lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch, you lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boyz, that's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today
Pro smoke, pro choke, anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take it, trick, I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya

Grippin' my steal, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
They tellin' me, "Bun, don't go there", but man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas but scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout or smokin' that joint 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain, and leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em from P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em, wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em to hell, to heaven
I just spent 60 G's on a brand new Eldo-reeze
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac, north star fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke when my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch 'cuz I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant, '84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed down Screw tapes that knock, blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks, try 20 ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas
'N got big ass diamonds off in they teeth

Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play, it don't change, ain't a thang to say
It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go
Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers, body rockers
Late night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerrilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us
Touched like Midas, these bitch ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch ass niggas ain't got no cheese?
Blowin' big kill
(Blowin' big kill)
Million dollar deals

Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Uh, puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J

<SONGSTART>(Andre 3000 with "I choose you babe!" in the back)
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F*** it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that b**** do you dirty
we'll wipe her a** out and send detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C)
Sweet jones
My b**** a choosey lover, never f*** without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for 40 dollars in the club
f***** up the game, b**** you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them b****es too scary
Your b**** chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Bun B)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
Because its greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
Im a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar b****
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C & B U N B
Cause whats a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoe
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose
OOOooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi)
Eeny mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl dont touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the C-Support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers couldn't stop the
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last pump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooooohhhhh Ooooooohhh
I chose you girl
IIIIiiii
I chose you baby

Throw it up on her she throw it right, back

Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin' crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper I gotta do it quick
Thinkin' I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin' wit, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live everyday like it's my muthafuckin' last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'ma die
But if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'ma take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say, "It'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby

Everyone wanna harm ya in New York niggas gettin' shot fo bombers
Now they got yo life in the former they in like California
Niggas wit dubs are hydroponic, marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pops died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wished it was twice mayn
I remember bein' eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not givin' a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' to the end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen fo damn near ten
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day you here but the next day you gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
I'm up early 'cuz ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets Peanut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin' shife, so shife back
Can't show no weakness wit these bitches life jacked
Mayn it's a trip where I stay especially for me
Them bitches tryin' to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga down in Florida Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I ain't no liar
My man BoBo jus' lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God why he let these killas live
And take my homeboy's son away
Man if you got kids show 'em you love 'em
'Cuz God jus might call 'em home
'Cuz one day you're here, the next day you're gone
I know, you know, well, well, yeah

I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pimpin' down the ave you know I'm lookin' tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that
Who's says he's going through a thang
When ya'll ain't never lied
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
When I hurt and try to hate 'cause she knows the thrill is gone
Say man, I stop smokin' with haters back in ninety four
But niggas thinkin' that a sweeps gone get the through my door
And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye to eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good

I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight
And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this away
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away
My dead homey momma's tear shit
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 503
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets just keep on gettin' live with me
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin' that
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains
It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to ESG and all the victims of the game
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood

I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I'm pimpin' through the ave. tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown, when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuck 'n' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood

You ain't never met a nigga like Pimp C hoe
'Fore you come into my room take off your shit at the do'

And if you fuckin with a Pimp then bitch your game is up
If your bitch get mad when you play this talk
Put her ass out on the highway, make that bitch walk
I ain't make this shit, fuck this shit old
You need to stop treatin these bitches like ladies

Standin on the front row, man this hoe a trip
She done opened up her legs and let me scope the pussy lips
Later on tonight, I'ma get behind her
I hope this bitch don't act like Pimp C care for no vagina
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Well you can catch me shoppin, checkin out the hoes boppin
Choppin up game to keep 'em lap hoppin
Pop in to the {?} show-stoppin
Proppin up a wheel and maybe ass droppin
Breakin haters off can't be mistaken for fakin
Fools are the ones left shakin, flakin
Marijuana deals with Jamaicans
Bakin up the powder to a fat cake an'
Mashin from the scene almost crashin, flashin
Cop lights keep a player dashin
Cash-in, on the crack course, paper stashin
With a passion for high-priced fashion
My dang clothes and my eighty-fo's clanky
God thank ye, motherfuckers actin cranky
Stanky, attitudes be janky

Croakin, sleepin motherfuckers 'til they woken

Why yo' ass yawnin? I'm flowin 'til the crack of dawn an'
Laughin as ya pawn ya posessions
Yes it's been worldwide tested
Showin off my diamond investments
[Pimp C:]
A bitch, ain't shit to a pimp
A twenty ounce steak and some fried side of shrimp
A 600 S's, now the 6 drop
Everything I ride original no kits on them chops

When I ride by all them bitches get they pussy all on fire
Bitches say I highside, hoe it ain't no thang

<SONGSTART>Hi life
We livin' that hi life
Hi life
We livin' that hi life
I'm tired livin' f**ked up, tired of livin' bad
Tired of grandmama telling me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm tryin to live up to the image
That she would want me to be
But I got one foot in the street and every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G but Niggas depend on me
It ain't fake to hit a 10 so niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushing cocaine niggas holding pistols
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20, 000 tryin' to turn it into a hundred, and ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas came to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch thinking she can ease my mind by suckin' my dick
Bitch make up for a minute cause that ship never last
In 1996 niggas is dyin' from layin' on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Easy-E died
And you be wonderin' why you niggas
Out there smokin'cri
I wish that I could tell y'aIl wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that nigga you know that I would be lyin'
And I been f**kin' pussy since the tender age of nine
It's gettin' to be a full-time job just tryin' to stay alive
And crack a scandalous smirk offended by the weed
Smoke comin' of my shirt
But I still put in work and front for my folks
'cause where I come from nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe
Some say that nigga's sellin' dope
And you know I ain't lyin' that just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the devil poke you
With his fork
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophet, f**kin' hoes
And gettin' paid
I'm looking for that
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life
You only got one life to live that's all they give us to do it
You could bullshit your way through it or stay true
It can be complicated cause niggas
Be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the people
In the lane get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive, take your positions
With pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dust
To see the only stretch rest see how we was left to be
Down these streets that we be on
Motherf**kers sleepin' on them corners that you be on
Probably because society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the f**k made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas sellin' that dank
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of the American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on who gives a damn
When you can't afford a turkey or ham
Livin' off of Ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab, it's far from me
To push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your man
And so instead of being without I'm hustlin' tryin' to
Get through these ungodly days
Thinkin' of ways to get the f**k out of this maze
A man'll commit a crime who the& f**k it crime pays
I'm goin' through a phase you don't go out until you
Out reason a motherf**ker
Gots to pour out this 40 on the curb, disturbed and
Left with no doubt in this mind
But still sometimes he don't know why he walkin' around just hopin'
He can get one more try to make it
It's a bullshit he goin' through but yo he gots,
You can't fake it to get the
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life

But the game been good to meeeee...
UHH, first album went platinum, now you can't go gold
Made ya deal with the devil, but you sold yo' soul
You rent a lotta cars, rent a mansion and them hoes
You say you sold your Phantom, bitch they took yo' Rolls
Get disrespected everywhere you go
Big bodyguards when you come for the shows
They already know you got shit on your name
Nigga, you a pussy, they gon' take yo' chain
Take yo' piece, rings and watch
You play rich, boy you need to stop
I ain't dissin nobody, no particular name
Ya shoe fit nigga, get the fuck up out the game - lil' BITCH!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
I'm a Down South MC, I'm cold on the mic
I say it how I feel and I do it how I like
I write what I see, what I do, and what I know
And keep it one hundred off top from the do'
Now whether at a show, in the booth, or on the street
No matter where I go and no matter who I meet
Everybody tryna tell me how they feel 'bout the South
On the cool, them haters need to shut they fuckin mouth
'Cause we grip grain, nigga we pop trunk
We to' straps and we ready for the funk
Some niggaz two-step, some niggaz dance
Some niggaz just ball wit' a bottle in they hands
Sell a couple ringtones niggaz, that's bread
You hatin on paper get that FUCK up out yo' head
Worryin 'bout my cheese, getcha own stack
It's goin down in the South, you don't like it
Click clack, motherfucker!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
You got caught with that work on 10
Made a deal with the state to turn your foul partner in
But he took 15, befo' you could tell
He ain't witchu no mo' hoe, you got twenty in a cell
I sent you a lawyer, you ain't listened that time
Ain't no appeal, but they dropped it to five?
Who you had to fuck to give back that time?
Textin me from a cell phone - bitch, yo lost YO' FUCKIN MIND?
How dare you tryna get me on conspiracy, Jack?
If the feds hit me, I'ma hit yo' ass BACK!
You fight witcho tounge, I send 'em killa
Transcript writer, I'll kill you nigguuuh!
(Smoke sum'hin, bitch.)
Got caught with the shit, twenty years
Youse a snitch, you turned biiii-tch.

Bought me all, of yo' dough.

(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush inside ? ? is fresh
Triple gold double-A Dayton's is the best, ugh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cos where I'm from fool that's what everybody play
UGK-1 written smooth on my plates
Cos real pimp players don't never roll fake
I'm bout to hit Dove Way, get past Troy's
I'm dippin by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass by the Colt I see some women lookin fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the trigger so it bump, ugh
I know you player-hatin busters wanna ride man
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy

It's pimpin pimpin, I'm hittin switches, checkin out my strap

Makin sure these snitches, ain't stoppin riches, 5-Oh on my back
I'm chillin, hidin and winnin, pockets feelin fat
(Bun B)
And I come round your corner shinin, leanin, ever so sunnin
Gangstas put down their gun and
women and children come outside and start runnin
They catch a glimpse of the P-A pimp whoopin whips
Never goin out out like simps, walkin your block with gangsta limp
(Pimp C)
Some fool roll Lincoln, some fools roll Jag
but the crew from Texas roll them Lacs, white gloss and rags
With the candy paint and wheel and grill, and wooden dash
'94 I gotta keep it trill, down for my cash
(Bun B)
I gots my stash so I switches, keep on burnin
and these tyres keep on turnin
I be rollin through your scene, flashin green, freaks be yearnin
to be down, the Under Ground Kingz drinkin Crown with the Coke
Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby
(Hook - x2)
(Bun B)
It's the tough boy, boulevard niggas, rollin around tan up
All four corners on your block fool, nuttin but that bunny hop

Interior crush and fool I'm through clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
in your soul so letta player take control
And do what the hell ya been waitin
to see and that's me rollin on three Dayton's
Wit one of them thangs in the air, it's hangin up there
Shinin steel fat man, but I don't care if everybody sit back and stare
Everywhere we go they linin up as if we're startin up a parade
And everybody thinkin they get paid
But I don't really give a damn, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
on a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right

<SONGSTART>Dear Lord, I know You don't condone
The things I be doin' out here in these streets
And I hope that, I pray that You can overlook
The wrong that I had done in my life
I don't know no other way to survive out here
I got a whole bunch of people dependin' on me
Just walk with me, walk with me
Busslin' and gamblin', hit licks scramblin'
Bricks, I'm out here handlin', I'm pimpin' and I'm payin' the rent
Didn't choose this dirty game, this dirty game, it chose me
Every city love cocaine, they'll get it from him
If they don't get it from me
So I get cross-country with that thang
Makin' that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin' that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
'Cause I put up sum from every sale so all my children can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell
But just put me in woodgrain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that sweet down 'cause that bullshit don't apply to me
'Cause out here on the real streets a dreamer always stay sleep
'Cause out here the strong survive
And now they didn't die from thankin' weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it hard, still tryna get right with God
Still read my Bible lone 'cause Reverend do wrong, still livin' fraud
Tonight if I get down on my knees
And ask the Lord to forgive me, please
You thank He gon' hear me?
'Cause tomorrow I'm still gon' be slangin' ki's
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
See, I was born in the ghetto, manye, I was raised in the hood
And unless you lived it yourself, it just can't be understood
People think hustlin' is cool or hustlin' is live
They don't understand hustlers only hustlin' to survive
They wished they lived in the 'burbs, wished they didn't have to hang
Out on corners in low-income house in projects and slang
They wish their daddy was home, mama wasn't on drugs
And they didn't have to grow up to be dealers and thugs
Po' children got aspirations and dreams just like the wealthy
But it's hard when that environment you live in ain't healthy
You ain't givin' no hope, nobody showin' you pride
And you live with all this anger and frustration inside
Dog, don't let nobody tell you what you can or you can't do
Just 'cause they funky ass couldn't do it, they ain't you
You can be who you wanna be, live life how you feel
Just put your faith in the Lord, now that's keepin' it trill fo' real
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's
For all the niggaz in the game that's been slangin' cheese
For all them boys on them swangers and their fifth wheel
I'm out here riskin' my life, niggaz shife but I stay trill
I pray so much, I wonder if the Lord love me
I think He do but I'm so caught up in my thug deep
The feds bug me, followin' me around for three
Niggaz couldn't catch me so they hit me with conspiracy
You know that that's the other level of the game
Ain't got shit on me but some niggaz said my name
So here they come, they thang tight
They playin' shife, no Bun, givin' me life
I ain't goin' back, I'm a make 'em kill me
I'ma bust back, fuck the pen, you feel me?
Wish I can hug my momma and kiss my baby girl
I know it's a better place than livin' in this dirty world
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Some people win and some people lose
Some always cryin' the blues, yeah
Some people win, some people lose
Some always bein' misused
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
'Cause I need You, Lord, right now
I need You, right now
Need Ya, I need Ya, I need Ya
I need Ya 'cause I'm goin' and livin' too fast, yeah

Candy paint sprayed by eddie and im ridin on that glassy chrome

Real hustlin's in my blood line
I dont complain or whine
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make
a dime I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind but now i see that road to riches
Its a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs
I peep game from the best and since then i been playin chess
I put in work with no rest
To get that paper thats my quest
Im on the slow grind towards success
One of the best 'cause i keep it fresh

Gave the game "True Religion" before you found it in denim
Feel the, "Wrath of Kane, " and you could not escape
The hip-hop version of "The Ring" and you just watched the tape (Next up!)
And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We Trill workin the wheel, understand nigga? (UNDERSTAND?)

I ain't Rocky but I keep her rockin
Fuck around I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket
Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin watchin my top fall in
On my Lambourghini with the quick scream
Fettucini, linguini, shrimp and a bowl of lean!
What you know about gettin cross country
Nigga your piece big but your diamond look monkey
You need to take that shit back
That ain't no emmy diamonds what the fuck you done to that...

Now, damn somebody need to beat Jacob's ass over that!
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Take it off
Baby take it all off
Uhh, take it off chick, bend over, let me see it
If you lookin for a trill-type figure, let me be it
Got the V-12 Benz, parked outside
It ain't enough room to fit dem gulls in my ride
It's on a, work somethin, twerk somethin basis
Makin big change, dancin in them tricks faces
She sleep in the day, but bump some booty at night
You kiss that thang and I'm out, cause she been playin with my pipe
Now get your mind right, hater, you a simp (a simp)
And I'm a red hot undercover pimmmmmp (pimmmmp)

You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick

It was a Secret that Victoria tried to hide
A little sly delight, I done pushed my pride aside
Just to slide inside, man I done died tonight
Now what I'm 'sposed to do? Been got close to you
Lookin like a poster to, don't wanna boast but you Missus
Do a Dr. Feel good, lay a playa real good
Limpin came back, and it was still good, she will
Put a few tips in her mouth, that's that definition
Of them true chicks in the South, let me do my thang
On the cool quick to the crotch, get the beds but guess what?
We kickin them hot, shakin it soft, should a been here
She did eight and the law, but you was late and you lost
Man she was takin it off
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick
I'm sitting, touchin' with my diamonds on, and man I
Miss that boy Pac, sippin' liquor tryin' to grip the chrome
I keep a chip off in my cell phone, they used to call me Pimp C
But now the chicks they call me James Jones
And if I skip I'm back to D-slangin, keep them boys nod-headed
Keep the boppers with they butts swangin
I used to be the young playa holdin
Now I leave them gulls with they jellyroll swollen, I'm rollin
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick
Comin direct from the Gentlemen's, full of that flint again
Live on stage fellas, this is Cinnamon
Fine, Black and feminine, I'm fin to win, look at the sin I'm in
Full of hallucinogens, me her and her friends
Now the venom in my snake, wanna poison
Come in with a brother and the boys and
Make sure you don't forget to bring the toys and
We stuck it check it, we gots to keep em gettin bucked naked
Makin it soft, we keep these boppers takin it off
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

<SONGSTART>Use me up, I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin' my mind
I'm trippin' and I know it 'cause I'm all nerved up
'Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin' my car
And everyday it get better, I can't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin' she ain't nothin' but a scrub
But she make me feel high like I'm hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I can't help myself, I know that I'm trippin'
But she got it goin' on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my credit card
You know she get it 'cause ya know that
(Chill, C)
I know, G, I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin' pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin' aw'll limp
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and still ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin' good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin' out them duckets and them, croka sacks
And everybody wonderin' why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, ask me why I wanna dis her
I told her 'cause her lovin' ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin' out and Byrd say I'm trippin' too
But this time I just can't listen to my whole crew
'Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But ninety two came around and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
To sum it all up, I'm breakin' all my rules
'Cause she got me droppin' off her little brother to school
I be gettin' bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on sex
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food
UGK sayin' peace out, and plenty of luck
And she could keep usin' Pimp C, uh, just a use me up
Ah, hah, well oh, baby, baby, baby

Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch, holla at yo' bitch, now yo' bitch on my team
Got her buyin' us sticky green, lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch, you lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boyz, that's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today
Pro smoke, pro choke, anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take it, trick, I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya
Rollin' Seville

Marijuana fields

Grippin' my steal, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
They tellin' me, "Bun, don't go there", but man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas but scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout or smokin' that joint 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain, and leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em from P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em, wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em to hell, to heaven
I just spent 60 G's on a brand new Eldo-reeze
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac, north star fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke when my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch 'cuz I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant, '84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed down Screw tapes that knock, blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks, try 20 ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas
'N got big ass diamonds off in they teeth

Bitch, how you feel? Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel
Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play, it don't change, ain't a thang to say
It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go
Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers, body rockers
Late night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerrilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us
Touched like Midas, these bitch ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch ass niggas ain't got no cheese?
Blowin' big kill
(Blowin' big kill)
Million dollar deals
(Million dollar deals)
Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Uh, puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J

with a piece of chain or Herringbone or nugget (nugget)
That don't mean him a real live hoe
You ain't ready to roll then go on then, fuck it
Out them ducats, hoes better recognize
Niggaz better recollect, Bun finna regulate

Leave that bitch dry and head to another state (hold up)
Me and my brother can't wait when it come to the red
Cause we about that cash, cash
So if we can't convince ya we'll take your sister
Hit the highway and mash
You got, bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got, bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got, bitches that can and you got bitches that cain't
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch
Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care
I like the girl with the pussy hair
My partner Mike Mo like the pussy bare
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swang Big Dick, swang Sweet Jones
Go and get the myth out the cobra head
Girl got down you niggaz scared
I got a young yellow bitch, I'ma sing it loud
With a four-inch corner of jet-mink hair
Between her legs is where it great
And get the money out the nigga when she go on a date
I stay caked up, rocked up
Magnum rubbers stay socked up
I ain't tryin to get the wet dick
Hold my good but she ain't that slick
I know you want this high-dollar cum
Bitch know I got money, wanna get her some
Bitch you must, done lost your mind
The trick's niggaz over there, you better get on the grind
Bitches not flexin ain't much good
I should and I would keep clear if I could
But when I do I just CAWN'T get away
Cause I gotta fuck all day every day
That leaves me run loco for real
All these chickenheads lie about deal
Ain't gotta do it up to make me chill
Find a good spot on the floor and kneel!
Know that my heart's in between my fires
Though I can't take when they look in my eyes
Lookin for love that's no surprise
Comin up off, that's family ties
Then I hit it from the back, all the way
Slap that back and just lock cross say
Not freeze out without no delay
Girls in the chat, I ain't got shit to say

If you fittin' ta ride foreign, then, nigga, you gotta chop
And Southern niggas still got the nerve to ride D's
I ain't hatin' on Daytons, but it's 2000, nigga please
It's all about the candy paint, it's all about the Vogues
It's all about the slab, baby, it's all about the hoes
Got some cars and some pros some real and some fraud
Hated on by a nigga, hated on by a broad
So long as J's sell, and them boppin' hoes slut

Get down on a dime, open up the store
Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor

Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor
(And she luv it)
Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor
These hoes loving the living, I'm giving all they can take
These hoes living for loving, I'm shoving dick til' they break
Put your feet in the sky, bring your knees to your chest
Grab a hold to the sheets, bitch, and I'ma do the rest
Get to pressing on your pink, gripping on your soft
To the side, take a ride, from the back I break you off
I want some pussy and some navel and some ass and some mouth
I ain't fucking for me bitch, I'm fucking for the whole south
Show me what you working with, bitch, what you got?
I really wanted to fuck but hoe you went and shaved your cock
A bald head pussy ain't shit, got them razor bumps bitch
Grow some hair and get legit
I make her get down on a dime, open up the store
Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor

Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor

Slide down slow, she getting down on the floor
Get down on a dime, open up the store

Distilled never loved always hated
Lifestyle, what a bad lifestyle
Bring it bad lifestyle, Coming down
Like Distilled liquid Bottled In confusion
You know I got a sickness, Coming down
With three Rap Album of the years
And no Album of the year given
Honestly, Screw the Grammies
I feel directed by this Sam Raimi
But this Spiderman ain't too happy
Where's my Mary Jane Watson
Where my options, Quit my job
Quit loven her, leave college, no, quit stopping
Comin down the walls, used to
Be afraid to fall, cause Life is
About picking yourself up
Coming down like an angel
No one on this Earth is hear to save you
Comin down like 100 percent
Fresh from head to toe, like
They still eat you up like
You're a rotten tomato
Comin down like you're a spider
You got talent why hide her
I learned life is not a simple plan
Takes a lot to be a man
I'm still the shit nigga

It's two wrongs on this track
Take the weight off my back
Remember don't blow my day
I'm a heart attack, Cohesive
Some mean shit, I just don't talk cold
I mean shit Comin down like Denzel in the Hurricane
Feel like they're starting fires
And igniting flames, anything
To take down No Came down
Taken for a conviction of triple
Murder, Rubin Carter's life was murdered,
Just like a black man criticized for controversy
Sometimes I start my own, most lies do hurt me
Coming down like a homicide victim,
Just cause I look and sound different
Comin down like James Bond, I'm on another
Mission 005.7 like the rate of homicide victims
Violent crimes are hard to retire, they never Will
I am fucking legend even if I am killed
I'm still that potion, to put haters
In to the motion, Say I'm the reason
For most to believe in, Let's say I'm everything
And there's nothing in between me, I'm
Still the muthafucking shit
I know everything
I know two things
I know nothing
I still can't muthafucking quit
West 3
Comin up, all I wanted to
Be in high school was a jock
A homecoming king, a volley-
Ball player, a boxer, a rockstar, a Rodney King
But no rapper has me beat
An actor, a rocker, a baseball
Player, a professional wrestler
Similar to Brock Lesnar
Even a ladies man, a bodybuilder
Once again a boxer, a skilled dribbler
A debater, snowboarder
A triathlete, a break dancer
Now I hate dancing, a wake boarder
Even a cheerleader, more like
A peer mediator, Who am I
Where's my first breath
Took profound leaps in every step,
I was even into football, ob course
Basketball, bring it soccer, even tennis
Can't stop winning, it's addictive
Life is a game board until you finish it
Even a lifeguard, but I still can't swim
I know everything
I know two things
I know three things
I still can't muthafucking quit

Comin down with that distilled
Never loved, better hated
Bring it hated, lifestyle
Coming down, once in
A while, you get good shoes now
Comin down with disappointment
Life is a deadly appointment
But it's important, know that's true
What's the difference between me and you
Comin down with the major talk
What am I going to do after college
Before I graduate, bring it Morgan
State, Comin down like
Bobby Brown
Last name a color and a noun
I have to cool it now
But I never will
When the world is hotter than Mills
And I'm not talking Texas County
I'm talking I will punish you
If you befoul me
Start a riot, if you lying
I still can't quit
till song ends
I'm distill the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga
I still in it nigga
I'm still the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga

<SONGSTART>So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F**k it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C:)
Sweet jones
My bitch a choosey lover, never f**k without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like the f**k for 40 dollars in the club
f**king up the game, bitch you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Bun B:)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B U N B
Cause what's a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoes?
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get jones
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi:)
Eni mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-saw pole
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b**** is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, walk it off from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
I, I choose you baby

<SONGSTART>PA, TA and I keep yelling it but y'all don't hear me though
On the cool, I'm trying to tell them it be the place
That I be laying low, lamping in my hometown
Niggaz ain't trippin', so I gets to keep my chrome down
And I be dippin' around the spots that niggaz pass
Swisha's, serving to the fiends, calling me
Mr. Big Buns, snatching checks from your momma
Making dollars, hoes holla, hustling bring ya drama
Uh but I don't sweat it fool, I come from where the best ride
Ain't no punks where I'm from on that West side
PA nigga, outta town with big nuts
Where outta town motherfuckers lose they life on the cut
But we ain't trippin', pass that dipplin'
And it's gonna be all right, soon as I get fried tonight
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
Well, I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm smoking big fat dank
I don't fuck around no mo with that goddamn drank
But every time I get down with my nigga Big Mike
We go and get a bottle of that Dom all night
I got that green monster baby, can you buy that?
Plus I got Swisha suit for days, you wanna try that?
I roll them, most of them big and fat they look like ball bats
I live in P A T, the East side, niggas sayin' jack
These laws be trippin' 'cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it in cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living a Mac
And I ain't trippin', flippin' then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
'Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes

I ain't got that time to waste, punch your mouth and knock out the taste
You MySpacin and Facebookin, playin games with them toys
I'm in the streets where gangstas meet, while you're online with them boys
So step your game up, build your name up, quit your talkin and quit your doin
All that planning and contemplating. when the f**k you gon' start pursuing?
Cars ain't driving themselves, mansions ain't building themselves

If you know like I know you would get down on the flo'
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisha full of 'dro
We can get down for my dime and we can f**k, on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha f**kin with me fo'?
Every lady ain't a hoe and every hoe ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't f**k around with no punks
Ride with me she holdin a pistol while I'm whippin and poppin the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems 'long as she hear what the f**k I said
Pimpin ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here livin by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm lookin at you you choosin me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm superstar, we headed to the top
(Chorus: sung)
I'm stayin true, I'm out here whippin my Mercedes
F**kin with the midnight ladies - the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm bangin Screwwww, my young girl lookin fine
We stayin out here on the grind - and keepin money on our mi-ii-iind
(Bun B:)
Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, gotta feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster-ass persona so hard it can dent, steel
In the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leakin fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust

Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leakin out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you gotta go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Gotta pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Gotta play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's yo' turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a f**k how you feel
(Chorus)
(Pimp C:)
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the SOOOOOOOOOUTH
This scary hoe don't wanna know what it's ABOOOOOOOOUT
Cause I stay country true down to the co', dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws, feel it tighten up don't stop don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars, f**k the D.A. f**k the law
I f**k the snow but I love a pro like flatbackers I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer, drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker, bitch around me man I'ma mack her
(Bun B:)
From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of 'dro and Impala bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki', and ten kilos grams in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's one point five mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is tickin, time is pressin
No second guessin, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK
(Chorus)
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S H O R T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be living naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell
I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fucking maker
'Cause I ain't taking, no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts
Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch
This dope ain't yo dope and these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafucking guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafucking road
And don't even try to come back nigga, yo
'Cause me Dre and C got fingers on a fat trigger
We making too much money moving weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper booming cold blow yo ass up
And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailing on yo bitch ass
But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas
Niggaz on the track dropping shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cooking up some llello for the local drug king
The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slanging some more white dust
Real, oh, so trill, the life's no glamor
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fucking up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home
And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales
Stupid muthafuckas smoking dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fighting Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops finding my stash, yo what could the worst be
Through so going undercover then turning dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Calling my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas
I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't 'bout to sell no fucking dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope but you still ain't selling shit
Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon' let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafucking cuts
So step in like I said before, we'll take them muthafucking nuts
Ask the last nigga brought his fucking ass down
Trying to sell that fucking dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'm a go to Port Arthur and run them fucking niggaz
Brought his fucking gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac
Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope
Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
'Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafucking killas
So have your shit attached, before you come check us
Pimp C, bitch, P.A. home, Short Texas

Roll like a stone, like my name Mick Jagger
Say it befo', had to tell you hoes again
Run a drum machine, like my name Roger Men
Write the rhyme do the beat, the hook and the mix

<SONGSTART>[Intro: Pimp C]
UHH...
Dedicated to all the underdogs, knahmtalkinbout?
Muthafuckas told me I wasn't gon be shit...
Told me I was gon be able to do this rap shit...
Knahmtalkinbout? My own family talked down on me, knahmsayin?
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (My uncle told me I wasn't gon be shit)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (I used to walk around with a bag full of rappers)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
(Motherfucker told me, a nigga from Texas couldn't make no record)
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
(Then after I made the record, muh'fuckers said they would never give us no respect)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... (But now they tryna rap like us)
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah... (Tryna be like us, tryna smell like us)
(Knahmtalkinbout?)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money... (Check this out)
[Pimp C:]
Man I refuse to let the bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up, but they cain't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a hoe open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a hoe for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
(right... right...)
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (hmm...)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (hmm...)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho...
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money...
[Pimp C:]
To all the babies havin babies on ya' own
I know you feelin fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, "Ya fucked up your life"
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy with lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggaz tellin you, "Ya crazy"
"What you thankin? You too young to have a family"
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggaz ain't gon ride witchu
But get down with that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin
It's time to change sumthin...
[Chorus]
[Pimp C:]
If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, "It ain't enough room in the NBA"
You tell them haters, "Save that bullshit for another day"
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, "You ain't gon make it", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase to hog it up, the lawyer end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be shame and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right...
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
... (Uh!)

They call me Mick Jagger 'cause I 'Roll a lot of stones'
It's a whole lot of clones but only one Sweet Jones
Turnin' whores to carnivores, they just can't leave my meat alone
It's been a long time since I busted on a glock
But every corner that I hit, I left it screwed up and chopped
Marooned up and dropped, like my Biarritz on top
Let the motherfucker bleed until it drip and let it drop
I'm still that young boy that had a pocket full of stones
But now I'm sick and simply rich, grippin' wood and flippin' chrome

Man I pull up in your city and get my Bush on
Lay down the competition, take their cash crops and get my push on
Moved up to Bentley with more chrome from a Lexus key
All because we cornered the market on that Texas tee
And we don't bar no plexes, we way bigger than other men though
The diamond deuces on tinted windows, we in the wind yo
We 'Chevro way' the wind blow, that's the corner we been Joe
Don't know where you been bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though
When it's ten fo', good, but in my Styrofoam good and muddy
We block bleeders, leavin' your neighborhoods good and bloody
We grippin' that woodler, bud it, sit back and scope it
Pay attention to Prince and pushin' everything about to pump it

Uh, I done smashed up my flyin' spurt, it wasn't shit
I just parked it in the grass and brought some brand new shit
A Phantom Rolls Royce, 24's with the bump
I ain't trippin' about the seat, I got them woofers in my trunk
Cut in my swisher, codeine on my whiskers
Fuckin' with that Smoke D, Bundy and that Vicious
UGK Records, it's an institution
Know a lot of niggaz livin' off of prostitution
Pimpin' ain't dead, it just moved to the web
Bitch ain't gotta hit the track, ain't gotta give no tricks no head
Ain't got to give no tricks, no pussy, just cameras and screams
Easiest money you can get, it's the American Dream bitch
Man I'm a middle finger figure, a million dollar mission
Poppin' like Orville Redenbacher, with a whippin' in the kitchen
Yayo like Dontrelle Willis, we the trillest on the mound
I'm holdin' that whole South down, I know you feel us
We the realest walkin' the planet
Can't stand it, pass away, wanna fight us
Start to swingin', wanna kill us, blast away, wanna stab us
Get to stickin but make sure you cut us deep
'Cause I betcha we comin' back a couple hundred brothers deep
Pimp and Bun, we run the streets, which streets? Man, pick your hood
Don't matter, we represented, cross us? We gon' get you good
Them Down South veterans, ain't nobody better than
Gonna tell your next of kin or your brethren, let us in cousin

Ay C keep yo' eyes open for the boppers, car hoppers
Daisy Dukes out on the block, showin cock, traffic stoppers
Lookin good spendin some nigga G's
Nails by Vietnamese, [unverified], lookin' like they worth G's
Dress above they knees, jellies and G-strings up the ass
Man I never let 'em pass
So, tell me where can I find 'em
With they nigga or in that candy Cadillac right behind him
Bitches tellin' me see yo' dick grand
All she wanna do is ride Su-bur-ban
Put her ass on the leather and rub the wood
See we got boppers in Texas oh, man that pussy look good
So, I let them hoes ride and I show them a grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
When she told me I looked good I didn't feel no pride
All the bitch wanted to do is just fuck my ride
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far

Assumin' that they body's too boomin to dispute
But pussy is the root of all drama
An attribute put up in they head by they momma
Oh yeah, I'ma tell it like it is, I sees how it goes down
Niggaz talkin' 'bout, how they passin' these hoes 'round
But y'all trickin', them hoes told me
Fools y'all ain't Goldy, ridin' in a goodie but an oldie
Fifty dollars there, a hundred dollars here
You brought the bitch a drink and all her homegirls a beer
Your homeboys lookin for ya, but yo' ass gone
You left your niggaz at the club and took all them hoes home
And didn't even fuck, man what the fuck
If you didn't want to fuck then get the fuck up out the truck
You know what I mean? I ain't showin out Vogues
Just so these hoes can be seen, c'mon you wanna fuck or cut?
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
When you look at my chrome and you lick your lips
It's just like I'm rubbin' my dick between your hips
And when you smile and shake your ass, my grill smile right back
Bitch I'm the real, that's why I ride Cadillac
And I'ma fuck you and fuck all yo' friends
Soon as Pimp C come through in that 600 Benz
With burgundy paint, butter and LG rims
Color TV, VCR playin X-rated films
Of myself, runnin up in beauty queens
But let me tell y'all niggaz the difference between y'all and me
You see, man I can tell all that bitch wanted to do
Is just ride for free and smoke for free
But bitch not me, you better ask them hoes if my name Pimp C
Unless your pussy makin ten thousand dollars a week
The only way I see you sittin in my passenger seat, you bitch!
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car

Summertime, Dapper Dan, candy ridin coupes
Wintertime, snow suits with the Louie boots
See the purse came first, the love came later
The pussy got wet and captain D came greater
I do it for the Bun and I do it for the Pimp
For the hustlers and the gangstas doin' time behind the fence

<SONGSTART>Intro (pimp c):
Where the hoes, where the hoes
lookin', lookin', tighten up, tryin' to tighten up
where the hoes, where the hoes
check it out
Verse 1 (pimp c):
I'm coming down candy, i put in my work
got a $10, 000 link medalion hangin' on a $2000 shirt
the game's been good
and all the hoes wanna sit on leather and the wood
bitches tryin' to price my diamonds
but that shit is just so common
'cause they see a nigga shinin'
but i'm movin' too fast
96 karats if you think that you could manage
got the drink and the salad
now the bitch is on the?
i'm comin' down gulf way, i'm tryin' to see what's up
i see big ass and some titties
now we flippin' in the 'bourbon to the city
the attitude's shitty but i bought no plex
ain't talkin' 'bout the malcolm but i'm ridin' on the x
the highway was so wet, i'm slippin' out my lane
the bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
i bet you never seen a big truck like that
i bet you never got a dick sucked like that
the bitch didn't know that i was tapin' the whole scene
now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen
the glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
i got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
tryin' to close me down, but i got ghetto love
i'm pimp c bitch, i'm comin' down richer than rich
so bitch you know you gotta gimme good stuff
Chorus:
Lookin' for that good stuff
ba ba ba ba da da da
tighten up on that backstroke
ba ba ba ba da da da
lookin' for that good stuff
tighten up on that backstroke
comin' down on fresh paint
blowin' swisher sweet smoke
Verse 2 (bun-b):
We flippin' worldwide, p.a.t. international jetsetters
bigger than the hollywood letters
but don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
breakin' off the jealous with pitch black barettas
my fellas and tellers who holdin' plates against them texas boys
bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex
like you major boy you have done played yourself
too $hort smoked you like a newport, and you bought
a one-way ticket to something bigger than you
over your head and got scared
exactly what i figured you'd do
now who you kiddin', i'm slangin', bangin', and skiddin'
busta playa moves and if you done it and did it
as i sit in the lap of luxury
dea is tryin' to stick bugs to me
undercover motherfucker tried to sell drugs to me
what could be more throw
mafioso puttin' bombs under my load
never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
now i'm comin' down shinin'
pieces and chains full of diamonds
i'm winin' and dinin' and caligula
pretty boys gettin' off the hook
bitches sayin' but i'm diggin' ya
but i know that make ya mega crunk
and make ya make it man it make a niggas wanna pop trunk
got skunk from the rasta, eatin' steak and lobster
like a mobster and gots to be lookin' for the good stuff
Chorus

<SONGSTART>Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
[Chorus:]
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin-swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
[Pimp C:]
When the top starts fallin the bitches start callin
My trunk start bangin and the fo's start crawlin
The drank mixed up, in the cream soda bottle
Her lips, hit my dick that's why I smashed on the throttle
Swisha Sweet candy, Robert Davis in my cup
I'm swervin like Bootsy but I couldn't give a fuck (fuck)
You see this car? (You see this car?)
You see this truck? (You see this truck?)
They both for me now watch them girls get buck (buck)
Ain't shit friendly but we still have fun (fun)
UGK for life, you know the Pimp and the Bun (Bun)
The great state of Texas, candy in the Lexus
Dick for them hoes jaws, pistols for the flexers
Somebody asked me why I'm ridin on the East
All I did was told the truth, the bullshit niggaz cease (cease)
If you ain't hatin nigga why the fuck you mad?
If your records ain't sellin, get your fingers out ya ass, bitch!
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Well it's the king of the trill (trill) wood wheel in my palm (palm)
Yeah I'm sittin sideways on suedes smokin that bomb (bomb)
The granddaddy kush mixed with a little O.G. (fo' sho')
That's my breakfast, off top I gotta blow three
Not to mention codeine, liquid and the pill (pill)
Bloats on my grill with my hand on my steel (steel)
Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing
I'ma gon' and pop the trunk, surely but slowly
Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your Colby Jet system (no)
Your slab ain't holdin, ain't no use to you frontin
And I'm fin' to shut the game down when I push the button
And the... [echoes]
[Chorus]
[Cory Mo:]
Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang
Cory Mo about to do the damn thaaaaang
In the butter guts with the diamond in the back
King Kongs in the trunk, hit the switch and watch it crack
I'ma let my paper stack and quote nothin but facts
So don't "ax" me nothin partner 'less you droppin some cash (cash)
Now she hoppin it fast (fast) that's just how I like it (like it)
Turn around and show me somethin girl I'm gettin excited (oooh)
Ain't nobody trippin cause the money already made
I done said it befo', so I'ma say it again
And let my top drop dowwwwwn
[Chorus]
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>It all started with a Pimp C, bitch
So what the fuck is up?
Told 'em somethin' good
Ease up my muthafuckin' cut
'Cause if you don't really wanna fuck wit a trill nigga
From the trill villa wit a steel trigga land of the real killers
Pop pop muthafucka there you go
I'ma bust 'em on yo ass if you don't ease up off me ho
'Cause trill niggas don't carry no sugar in they nutsac
Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack
So you gon' give me my money but you don't hear me though
But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes
P.A. nigga, trill ass nigga
How you figga you can buck me down nigga?
Mr. big an, Mr. big time, give me what's mine
Instead of buying cars for a bitch named sunshine
Give me what's mine, give me what's mine
Before it come down to triggas
Shit, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Bitch, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Uh, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
But you can't hear me
It's the return of the trill ass niggas bitch
Yea muthfuckas, I figured you run
I figured you run, when I pull triggas to guns
That triggas to guns P.A. fool a nigga named Bun
A nigga named Bun, no more sun, no more shine
Say hello to the nine milly millameter
(Buck, buck, buck)
Money tight glock, bustin' them shots
When I break yo ass off somethin' hot
Niggas steady catchin' lead to the head
I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin' bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin', niggas start passin' away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise, I'm gettin' Chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now it's the return of the trill ass niggas

Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
You know Bun B the business street soulja in the trenches
Frontline comin' down on twenty four inches
Dope boys hangin' on the corners and the benches
Sayin' it's a drout so it's plenty of heat pinches
Boy, used to come up from the rags to the riches
Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches
But now it's like the game is full of nothin' but some snitches
And wanna be gangsters that's scared to put 'em in ditches
Fed's takin' pictures so the cameras go click
And video rollin' while I'm holdin' my dick
They follow me around like they doin' they job
But while you watchin' me how many people gettin' robbed
Lets keep it trill 'cause we already know
What it already is and how it already go
That's why we chop blades comin' down real slow
Pop trunks, swang, riders slam Cadillac door
Pass the swisha let's blow
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Before we get started, every body roll up one for Pimp C
Before we go any further, take your lighter, light it up for me
Now let's go, now let's go and all the girls get down on the floor
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
I'm whippin' big wheels, whippin' big wheels
Hope your drink don't spill whippin' big wheels
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel
lady on my side, hey
And if you all down for me
Put your hands in the air raise 'em up for Pimp C
And if you all down with me
Put your hands in the air raise 'em up for Pimp C

These other broads hatin on her, if they sick they need to throw up
She got class and panache with precision
Picture perfect in my vision and I done made a decision
That I'm tired of wishin, get down with the Bun and Pimp and
You could roll with the playas on the million dollar mission, c'mon
Uhh, hey mama, I'm a tell you what the deal is
I like your style, I like how you handle your business
You ain't out here trippin chasin boys in showbiz
You're confident, you out here puttin it down for yo' kids
I don't care 'bout no nigga, he don't concern me
He ain't teachin you nothin, you need to learn me
Check out my mind, I'm 24 on the grind
I got the key to the streets, I got a open line
And I don't get caught up in "he say, she say"
And I don't chase the cat, I keep the P play
I wouldn't holla if I ain't thought you was ready boo
I know you feelin me, cause girl I'm feelin you
Ooh baby (ooh baby)
Ooh baby (oh baby)
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up now
Yeah she a bad mamma-jamma, a brick, house
Still I fits, out, cause she thick, stout
With the feminine fat, in all the right places
She look me in my eyes and she make all the right faces
Cause she's a real catch, we make a tough pair
A true dynamic duo and we up there
We sittin tall at the top
And if she ride or die for me playa I'm a give her all that I got
I break her off and not, let her hold the keys
I don't take her out of town, man I take her oas
It ain't trickin if you spend it on your lady
Bring the bacon home to baby and everything'll be gravy
Just let me know if that's soundin like a plan
Cause all you really need to change your life is the man
And you appealin to the King of the Trill and
I just wanna know if you're feelin me like I'm feelin, you

[Bun B]
A bad day for the niggaz in my click
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It's seems the drug situation is so tow up
And poes down the fuckin T-X had to show up
I got shit on the scene so 99 can't hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret and there's no rest
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
In Dynasties.I-ROCs... and Caravans and muthafuckas are swolen
Like paper stacks and a rubberband
Goin all out of tact on the local bird slaggin brothaman
And be servin as slow as fuck
Cause my niggaz are nervous
and if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggaz is happy with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town
Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my tags off my buick and yall know I didn't love that
Rollin on some white balls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, YOU GOTS TO DO YOUR OWN NAILS!
I told my niggaz to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town
God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back up!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my click
Got the birds, and reopen my lab back up
And told my boys, "If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye,
Don't give him a chance to identify!"
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at random, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Close to the dopeman - God damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
CAUSE IN MY YARD IS A BIG ASS - I GOT YALE SIGN!
It's time for TONY MONTANA stacks
I got niggaz on the corner holdin big ass bags and cans of crack
The land of Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fools run in with your glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last love
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight lights
when the feds in town
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

Ridin' dirty, for real tho, ridin' dirty
Have you ever been rollin' in a clean ass 'Lac
Blowin' big out the window, everybody got a sack
Got my heat right between my seat, got a box of them thangs
In case these fools start playin' with me
You'd be surprised how them boppers wink, girl, I can't stop
Give my headlights a blink and roll them up out the top
And keep movin' and keep rollin'
Fools that don't be holdin' I'm comin' through and foldin'
And I can't stand snitches, wanna kill all of y'all
Even though some bustas fall I'm still rollin' like a ball
And having things my way, hittin' that highway
Sellin' that big yay, a plush-ass place to stay
Police, they wanna run in
Talkin' on cell phones got a lotta kids done in
I wanna live like Arnold, Willis and Mr. Drummond
And keep my paper sturdy, big birds and tight herbs
Fool, I'm ridin' dirty
Big birds and tight herbs, fool I'm ridin' dirty
Ridin' dirty, fool, ridin' dirty
Tell me can you feel it? Man, nothin' can save ya
I believe it's that season for gettin' yo papers
Or haven't you heard about them birds? We call it that cheese
In Texas we get it with ease, hit I-10 if you please
But these polices, they think they sharp as creases
For no reasons, man, they straight up strippin' cars to pieces
Out of suspicion or if they thinkin' you on a mission
Ain't no wishin' or prayin', they sayin' assume the position
Hands behind ya head, down on ya knees
You get the case and they get yo weight and yo G's
Come on, I use to ride the Port Arthur city streets
With a chick with pretty feets and a box of Philly Sweets
They tried to finish me but couldn't get it done
So somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty

[Chorus: sampled from Chaka Khan & Rufus' "Something Good"]
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah... yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
[Bun B:]
Aiyyo, what's up with that bulge in ya khakis?
You wanna pack a gat, but you STILL ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gangload of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cause by yourself, you're runnin to the flo'
I seen your kind befo', man ya nothin with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin when ya chillin with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin up some daisies
See crazy you wanna be, but punks with no heart, they ain't hard
They just waitin for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep your weak self locked in ya hood
Cause without your boys I'm a have to tell ya somethin good
[Chorus]
(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)
[Pimp C:]
Brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check ya girl and what she did in the past
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her REAL fast
But I don't trust the dugout, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check ya blood and let somebody check your teeth
But if you don't step, I'm a drop on ya fast
And pump off bullets like government cash
I didn't do ya girl but your sister was alright
Took her to my homeboy's Caddy last night [girl moaning in the background]
She waxed my jimmy, and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit if from the back, and the girl just THREW ME
Told me, "Pump it harder, " and she scratched me on my BOOTY
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty lil' girl
[Chorus 1/2]
[Bun B:]
Let's talk about these half-n-half punks
By day they sorry bastards, at night they talkin bout, poppin trunks
Butter .25 cain't keep you alive
From a sawed-off, fool so I hope you survive
See bluffin might save ya tail one day
But who's ta say, it won't catch ya next week, on the runway?
You might shoot a few shots in the wind
But the same time tomorrow, you'll be runnin again
Now can you keep it up, every damn night?
You steady runnin to the argument but runnin from the fight
What's the deal man? Why don't you take your Raiders cap off?
Cause one of these days, you gonna getcha head slapped off
You cain't keep a crew cause they gettin sick of seein you bail
Like a punk'll hit the backstreet trail
And the women don't like you cause ya act like them
And that's why your little jimmy never went fo' a swim
Ya talk about slangin, makin G's
But I saw a fiend chase ya from, BJ's up to Mickey D's
Now everyday punks get took
Either for they dough, they'll ride 'em for the powder that they cook
You bookin from the scene cause ya couldn't hold ya own
A 40 ounce bottle slams, ya dead to your dome
Now you want revenge, so ya get your automatic
Find a group of hard-heads, and startin kickin static
Ya pulled ya little chrome but these fools got gats
Try to run and caught two buckshots in ya back
Now you nothin but a memory that's gone in a slayin
So when I tell you somethin good, punk I don't be playin

[Pimp C:]
(Uh, Uh) One time for yo' muthafuckin'...(whuut)
Back, bitch (uh)...Kool Ace (whuut), UGK...(huh)
[Chorus: Pimp C]
Pimpin' ain't no illusion,
And pimpin' ain't never died.
Mo' pimps was on that heroin
And yo' pimp tripped out on that fry.
The dikes done came through
And straight threw off all the game;
Got all these hoes thinkin'
They could manage they own change.
[Kool Ace:]
But it ain't no illusion,
I know... you all have witnessed
He rollin' in my Caady mo'
Wit' fly bitches,
Makin' ole deals: Now, ho (huh, huh)
Ain't Bob Barker
But I'm caught up in this game
Mo' like... Peter Parker.
P-I-M-P, take the P's that I am.
I want you payin' hoes in my army
Like... uh... Uncle Sam,
And we gon' jam...
I'm talkin' 'bout the world greatest show
I know my shit is extreme
But I'm all about them does.
When I'm steppin' on the scene
Be there four deep... hella clan
My reality is your favorite dream
(Stop that shit, daddy...)
Best believe Kool Ace gon' keep it real.
Pimp C & Bun B to testify for the ear
Excuse me, y'all, but this about Southern shit.
Now, tell me can you... uh... feel this, bitch?
We givin' 'em brain contusions...
Pimp C, what's the conclusion?
[Pimp C:]
Pimpin' ain't no illusion...
[Chorus: x2]
[Pimp C:]
Pimpin' ain't dead... nigga, it just began
(How the fuck you know Sweet Jones?)
My hoes still out there sellin' ass.
Yo' bitch is out of pocket,
'Cause yo' pimpin' was scary;
Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy.
Fuck niggas watch them mack and pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what y'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'.
This is the conclusion: pimpin' ain't no illusion.
[Chorus: x2]
Bun B:
If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her,
'Cause a beggar ain't a muthafuckin' chooser.
Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean.
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a wif a this...
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior... and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny... sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again... that's why...
[Chorus: x2]
Too $hort:
You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money... it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game.
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it.
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin'...beeyatch.
[Chorus: x3]
...pimpin' ain't no illusion
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part."
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it"
"Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets"
"Had to tie her to a rocket"
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up"
"Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up"
"(Shit)"

And, all this money they make and bring it back to these niggaz man

Oh, I'm not talkin 'bout me, man, I'm talkin bout them other niggaz
And that's real, from the big cities to the small towns

<SONGSTART>Hold up
It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital
Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that
There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?"
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution

So I'm digging in my mind for the bitches I broke
And keep a player paid in full cause pimping ain't no joke
You want to pop that pussy that's a slim ass chance
Put the paper in the panties when you get that dance
This C.O.D. nigga, so you can keep your nuh plastic cards
No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers
But why slap us when you think a nigga down on his luck
You try and flag us when you see us coming down in a buck
Now what the fuck part of the game taught y'all that bitch play
See we makes a bitch pay

And then a bitch stay
Wouldn't sit still
Fuck how this shit feel

This shit real pimping

And you know that we always blowing herb (blowing herb)
And in the club man you know we stay strapped (stay strapped)
And bitch you know that it ain't about this rap (ain't about this rap)

Fuck me right and suck me tight
And you just might hit the blunt hoe
I don't stunt and blow smoke up your ass baby
But don't be acting all saditty with class baby
You with a nigga such as my self it'll cost you
So pay before a nigga fuck around and be the tosser
Sweet Jones, gripping grain
With all that shit you talk ain't got no bezatine chain
And most of y'all niggaz ain't nothing but tricks
But we sipping lean and breaking bricks
Popping pills, work the wood wheel
Fuck where you're from and fuck how you feel
If you want to go to war I'll take you to war

Niggaz wanna do my dirt
Balling down on Beale Street
Sipping on a pint of syrup
Chopping up the chronic weed
Picking all the fucking seeds
Trying to slow my roll
In my trunk I got them fucking keys
Always riding Chevy things
Shining on them twanky things
Kids I'm a role model
Police I'm a dope man
Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead
Never has it left my mouth
Optimos a fifth of crown
Red eyes with a frown
Niggaz with them gold teeth
Fast talking on the town
Some of us are under cover
Make your baby mama love us
Knot in my right pocket
Left pocket got them rubbers
Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash
I'mma go pimp a bitch

Always got to watch your friends
Backstabbers cause a snitch
Now see let me blow your mind the real business in the wind
The main thing fucking up these hoes is their fucking friends
You remember back in day it was niggaz pimping hoes
Take a look around now it be hoes pimping hoes

Make me walk up in the strip and kind of get like buck
Oh you fucking with my cheese oh you fucking with my paper

Cause she got to get it done but that thing ain't my world

Pussy nigga, thinking you gon kill me

Putting dick up in your daughter, rap is over I serve some cheese
Nigga talking bout, robbing Chad
Run up on me with that first, will leave you stinking in the grass
If your calico to mask, if you Baptist go to church
See a hoe up in a nigga, gon pull up a skirt
That'll be, some incredible shit
Niggaz scheming on my bezel, on some devilish shit
I been to hell and back, on another level you bitch
Go on try it I'm going live, they gon need a shovel for you bitch
I been stabbed I been shot, went from no fans to being hot
But somehow always fall short, for trying to keep fiddles in my pot
In a dog eat dog world, y'all fellas be chasing girls
When I place myself in history, too hot for a ladder to catch me
But I can't help but to notice, I'm one of the coldest
And I know y'all haters love when I'm locked up, but I won't lose focus
Yeah I wrote this counting down, how many days I got
So lately my gun ain't been hid, it's been displayed a lot
My attitude is fucked up, I don't give a fuck cause I just don't give one
Thinking bout living a life where everything you do right is wrong, mo'fucker I live one
I know niggaz wanna kill me, but I'm still riding pride
Cause the Lord riding with me, and that's the main reason why
Some niggaz win, and some niggaz lose
Some niggaz getting bruised, some always crying to blues
Some niggaz already lost, and ain't gon lose no mo'
Big shoes hoe choose, ain't paying dues no mo'
Everything y'all trying to do, I built a school hoe
Now it's fly to talk country, I made the rules hoe
I was sagging in my khaki's, 'fore Dickies cool
Gangsta Nike's on my feet, our music banging in the streets
The young B.G.'s, really love to thump
Fuck radio and BET, I'm out here bumping in the trunk
For the girls popping pussy, and the boys with the blow
Cadillac'ers and flat-backers, I'm out here repping for it hoe
Can't any man, boy or woman take away my soul
It's a gift given from God, and I'm keeping a tight hold
The world is ugly and cold, trying to make me the same
But I'ma keep it one hundred, when it come to the game
Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up
We keep it click tight, so when niggaz start lurking
In the dark heaters start, anybody start jerking
Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg
A dragging society, don't borrow don't beg
For tomorrow so gon 'head with your pity, I'ma be cool
Kindergardeners was looking up to me, in pre-school
Down with Pimp C fool, and P-A-T the town
Representing it to the fullest, till I'm gone I hold it down
Bun Beater, would never sell you no lie
So if you ask for the truth, I'ma reply to trill niggaz don't die

Big Dick Cheney and Snowy Snow, (cocaine cocaine)
(Pimp C:)
Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggaz, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'ma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose
Cocaine, cocaine
(Bun B:)
They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Columbia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine
(Rick Ross:)
You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
And my yayo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

My issue you neglectin, seem to me you disrespectin
Boy don't play with my pape's cause I'ma gon' spray where you stay
Pull out that K in a day and get done away like you fake
Straight out P-A short Texas, servin trees on the West (West)
A money-makin machine, nigga I do it best
With the cream and the cash, by any means I'ma mash
So go get my green out the stash, walk with that beam in ya ass

Get the cheese, whip the blow, hit the sneeze, hit the dro
She on her knees in the low, I make 'em get down on the flo'
Flo', you niggaz say you want a better price
Price, you got it but it ain't gon' hook right
Drop seven on lock tight, fuck wit it the whole night
Try to hit and she hid the Sprite, got you mad like Tina and Ike
Ike, my product always cover up good
Good, nigga I can put that on my neighborhood
Hold Arthur right on the water, white powder and hella snorter
Nigga wanna buy eight I brought 'em
slowly off and then I ate in the squadda
Uhh, now nigga look at how the time change
Change, check out the Jordans on this wide frame
Whippin out and grippin gram, new truck or candy slant
Makin young girls drop it I, hit the slab bitch hit the block
Let me get these niggaz for you Pimp!
Let me handle this shit for you Bun, I got you!
You know it's a team, UGK alumni
Ain't nuttin!

Ask yourself, cheap in Texas if you can drive past
Besides that, nigga current or make five cents
It's seven eight or nine, seventh time a month supply that
By fifty thousand, no more browsin, bitch I'm buyin that
I'm ridin 'Llac with three old Benzes right behind that
Fifth comin down we be flexin, fives and sixes in GTS's
Chrome tips with VVS's, neck and chest in VVS's
Oh yes it's, the mob better get your mind right
Ay Tip ain't goin home, that don't even sound right
You niggaz actin like a broad, I don't wanna fight
Nah I ain't gon' squab but I will have a gun fight
We finna hit the streets with the glock, with the G's in the block
Trappin on like a traffic stop, then sooner or later I have a knot
Got money from Bankhead to Groverland, fuck your head back to Simpson Road
Down South fakers known for gettin paper
then some of the hill niggaz still know, for sho' they know
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>[Bun B]
Yeah, 976-Bun B

Cause the dick's hangin low, and it's still fat
But ain't shit whack so you better pull a quick guard
This shit is live enough to make your MOMMA'S dick hard
(C'mon!) Pick up ya phone and dial the 7 numbers that makes ya trip
for live shit comin from Bun B's lips
And I'm givin hoes the sensation of a big-ass nut

Courtesy of Bun B, straight to motherfuckin you
Yo, the nigga was trill, same shit, new place

Yeah niggaz be trippin yo, but still in the meanwhile
Your girl keeps callin me on motherfuckin redial

You catch me at the mo-tee, Bun big bone a fill' up
She might be shit to you, cause dude give her pay G
But pussy get played out, and pussy comes daily
As long as your game be strong ain't no thang
My phone always rang cause of the dope shit I sang
Keepin hoes on my dick yo, and ain't no lettin go
The net keeps flyin out, the pussy stays wet so
I turn on my VCR then I put a flick in
The hoe starts lickin that dick and pretty soon
I'm stickin that ass, like a fool in the bed
All I can see, is the top and back of your head
It ain't about conversation or make that hit
On a first name basis hoe that ain't bout shit!
Look trick, tell me how many rubbers to pack
I hit the room from the front, the ass from the back
And yo it ain't about the phone call, this about the nut'n
So let me bust a fat load on your bellybutton
See, quiet storm done put a notch on your belt
And when it's over, I don't wanna hear how it felt
I'm just pullin off my rubber, takin a bath
Gettin dressed to reminisce of how I cut ya in half
It's all in the day of an Underground fool
So dial the digits and I'm divin in that ass like a pool
But when I get wet BITCH, I won't be drownin
I clown on hoes to leave their pussyhole frownin
Or if you bitches wanna hear some more of this
Lock your bedroom door trick, pick up your cordless
You can suck a mean dick, lick a good ball
And if I keep on fuckin, you'll keep on callin
And I'll be playin you, when you think you'll be playin me
It's just pussy games with some help from AT&T
So if you need a dick to be real friendly
Dial nine-seven-six, B-U-N-B, bitch!

Like my syrup and swisha can't leave without it when I ride
Even though I'm the king of the city where I reside
I wouldn't and couldn't do it without my woman on my side
Sometimes I got it figured out, sometimes I'm confused
I win 9 times out of 10 but now and then I might lose
But no matter the road I choose and how the drama unfold
A playa always got his better half right on his shoulders
She gon' hold me down to the fullest, rainy or sunny
She seen me ball out of control and dead broke with no money
So when the game got funny, she ain't pack up and roll
She help me get back on my feet now man that's way too cold

So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F*** it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that b**** do you dirty
we'll wipe her a** out and send detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C)
Sweet jones
My b**** a choosey lover, never f*** without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for 40 dollars in the club
f***** up the game, b**** you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them b****es too scary
Your b**** chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Bun B)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
Because its greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
Im a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar b****
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C & B U N B
Cause whats a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoe
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose
OOOooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi)
Eeny mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl dont touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the C-Support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers couldn't stop the
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last pump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooooohhhhh Ooooooohhh

So I start sellin' crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper I gotta do it quick
Thinkin' I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin' wit, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live everyday like it's my muthafuckin' last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'ma die
But if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'ma take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say, "It'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby

This world we livin' in man it ain't nuthin' but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya in New York niggas gettin' shot fo bombers
Now they got yo life in the former they in like California
Niggas wit dubs are hydroponic, marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pops died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wished it was twice mayn
I remember bein' eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not givin' a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' to the end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen fo damn near ten
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day you here but the next day you gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
I'm up early 'cuz ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets Peanut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin' shife, so shife back
Can't show no weakness wit these bitches life jacked
Mayn it's a trip where I stay especially for me
Them bitches tryin' to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga down in Florida Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I ain't no liar
My man BoBo jus' lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God why he let these killas live
And take my homeboy's son away
Man if you got kids show 'em you love 'em
'Cuz God jus might call 'em home
'Cuz one day you're here, the next day you're gone
I know, you know, well, well, yeah

Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that

When ya'll ain't never lied
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on

Say man, I stop smokin' with haters back in ninety four

And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye to eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life

I see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight
And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this away
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away
My dead homey momma's tear shit
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 503
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets just keep on gettin' live with me
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin' that
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains
It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to ESG and all the victims of the game
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good

I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I'm pimpin' through the ave. tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown, when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuck 'n' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good

You ain't never seen, how a pimp be oh so clean
Fly women and fancy thangs, fly bitches and pinky rangs

You ain't never met a nigga like Pimp C hoe
'Fore you come into my room take off your shit at the do'
If you comin to my hotel then you came to fuck
And if you fuckin with a Pimp then bitch your game is up
If your bitch get mad when you play this talk
Put her ass out on the highway, make that bitch walk
I ain't make this shit, fuck this shit old
You need to stop treatin these bitches like ladies
and these nice ladies like hoes
Standin on the front row, man this hoe a trip
She done opened up her legs and let me scope the pussy lips
Later on tonight, I'ma get behind her
I hope this bitch don't act like Pimp C care for no vagina
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Well you can catch me shoppin, checkin out the hoes boppin
Choppin up game to keep 'em lap hoppin
Pop in to the {?} show-stoppin
Proppin up a wheel and maybe ass droppin
Breakin haters off can't be mistaken for fakin
Fools are the ones left shakin, flakin
Marijuana deals with Jamaicans
Bakin up the powder to a fat cake an'
Mashin from the scene almost crashin, flashin
Cop lights keep a player dashin
Cash-in, on the crack course, paper stashin
With a passion for high-priced fashion
My dang clothes and my eighty-fo's clanky
God thank ye, motherfuckers actin cranky
Stanky, attitudes be janky
I think he, gon' hafta feel the sting from the rang on my panky
[Intro + Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Think I ain't heavy strokin, you must be jokin
Tokin, on some shit I don't even be smokin
That coke and, marijuana got yo' ass loc'n
Croakin, sleepin motherfuckers 'til they woken
I'm still crunk at five in the mornin'
Why yo' ass yawnin? I'm flowin 'til the crack of dawn an'
Laughin as ya pawn ya posessions
Yes it's been worldwide tested
Showin off my diamond investments
[Pimp C:]
A bitch, ain't shit to a pimp
A twenty ounce steak and some fried side of shrimp
A 600 S's, now the 6 drop
Everything I ride original no kits on them chops

When I ride by all them bitches get they pussy all on fire
Bitches say I highside, hoe it ain't no thang

<SONGSTART>Hi life
We livin' that hi life
Hi life
We livin' that hi life
I'm tired livin' f**ked up, tired of livin' bad
Tired of grandmama telling me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm tryin to live up to the image
That she would want me to be
But I got one foot in the street and every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G but Niggas depend on me
It ain't fake to hit a 10 so niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushing cocaine niggas holding pistols
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20, 000 tryin' to turn it into a hundred, and ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas came to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch thinking she can ease my mind by suckin' my dick
Bitch make up for a minute cause that ship never last
In 1996 niggas is dyin' from layin' on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Easy-E died
And you be wonderin' why you niggas
Out there smokin'cri
I wish that I could tell y'aIl wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that nigga you know that I would be lyin'
And I been f**kin' pussy since the tender age of nine
It's gettin' to be a full-time job just tryin' to stay alive
And crack a scandalous smirk offended by the weed
Smoke comin' of my shirt
But I still put in work and front for my folks
'cause where I come from nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe
Some say that nigga's sellin' dope
And you know I ain't lyin' that just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the devil poke you
With his fork
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophet, f**kin' hoes
And gettin' paid
I'm looking for that
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life
You only got one life to live that's all they give us to do it
You could bullshit your way through it or stay true
It can be complicated cause niggas
Be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the people
In the lane get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive, take your positions
With pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dust
To see the only stretch rest see how we was left to be
Down these streets that we be on
Motherf**kers sleepin' on them corners that you be on
Probably because society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the f**k made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas sellin' that dank
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of the American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on who gives a damn
When you can't afford a turkey or ham
Livin' off of Ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab, it's far from me
To push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your man
And so instead of being without I'm hustlin' tryin' to
Get through these ungodly days
Thinkin' of ways to get the f**k out of this maze
A man'll commit a crime who the& f**k it crime pays
I'm goin' through a phase you don't go out until you
Out reason a motherf**ker
Gots to pour out this 40 on the curb, disturbed and
Left with no doubt in this mind
But still sometimes he don't know why he walkin' around just hopin'
He can get one more try to make it
It's a bullshit he goin' through but yo he gots,
You can't fake it to get the
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life

But the game been good to meeeee...
UHH, first album went platinum, now you can't go gold
Made ya deal with the devil, but you sold yo' soul
You rent a lotta cars, rent a mansion and them hoes
You say you sold your Phantom, bitch they took yo' Rolls
Get disrespected everywhere you go
Big bodyguards when you come for the shows
They already know you got shit on your name
Nigga, you a pussy, they gon' take yo' chain
Take yo' piece, rings and watch
You play rich, boy you need to stop
I ain't dissin nobody, no particular name
Ya shoe fit nigga, get the fuck up out the game - lil' BITCH!

I'm a Down South MC, I'm cold on the mic
I say it how I feel and I do it how I like
I write what I see, what I do, and what I know
And keep it one hundred off top from the do'
Now whether at a show, in the booth, or on the street
No matter where I go and no matter who I meet
Everybody tryna tell me how they feel 'bout the South
On the cool, them haters need to shut they fuckin mouth
'Cause we grip grain, nigga we pop trunk
We to' straps and we ready for the funk
Some niggaz two-step, some niggaz dance
Some niggaz just ball wit' a bottle in they hands
Sell a couple ringtones niggaz, that's bread
You hatin on paper get that FUCK up out yo' head
Worryin 'bout my cheese, getcha own stack
It's goin down in the South, you don't like it
Click clack, motherfucker!

You got caught with that work on 10
Made a deal with the state to turn your foul partner in
But he took 15, befo' you could tell
He ain't witchu no mo' hoe, you got twenty in a cell
I sent you a lawyer, you ain't listened that time
Ain't no appeal, but they dropped it to five?
Who you had to fuck to give back that time?
Textin me from a cell phone - bitch, yo lost YO' FUCKIN MIND?
How dare you tryna get me on conspiracy, Jack?
If the feds hit me, I'ma hit yo' ass BACK!
You fight witcho tounge, I send 'em killa
Transcript writer, I'll kill you nigguuuh!

"Got front and back, and side to side"
(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush inside ? ? is fresh
Triple gold double-A Dayton's is the best, ugh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cos where I'm from fool that's what everybody play
UGK-1 written smooth on my plates
Cos real pimp players don't never roll fake
I'm bout to hit Dove Way, get past Troy's
I'm dippin by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass by the Colt I see some women lookin fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the trigger so it bump, ugh
I know you player-hatin busters wanna ride man
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy
(Hook - x2)
(Pimp C)
It's pimpin pimpin, I'm hittin switches, checkin out my strap

Makin sure these snitches, ain't stoppin riches, 5-Oh on my back
I'm chillin, hidin and winnin, pockets feelin fat
(Bun B)
And I come round your corner shinin, leanin, ever so sunnin
Gangstas put down their gun and
women and children come outside and start runnin
They catch a glimpse of the P-A pimp whoopin whips
Never goin out out like simps, walkin your block with gangsta limp
(Pimp C)
Some fool roll Lincoln, some fools roll Jag
but the crew from Texas roll them Lacs, white gloss and rags
With the candy paint and wheel and grill, and wooden dash
'94 I gotta keep it trill, down for my cash
(Bun B)
I gots my stash so I switches, keep on burnin
and these tyres keep on turnin
I be rollin through your scene, flashin green, freaks be yearnin
to be down, the Under Ground Kingz drinkin Crown with the Coke
Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby
(Hook - x2)
(Bun B)
It's the tough boy, boulevard niggas, rollin around tan up
All four corners on your block fool, nuttin but that bunny hop
happenin, high gassin, daily routine, my load is plush
Interior crush and fool I'm through clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
in your soul so letta player take control
And do what the hell ya been waitin
to see and that's me rollin on three Dayton's
Wit one of them thangs in the air, it's hangin up there
Shinin steel fat man, but I don't care if everybody sit back and stare
Everywhere we go they linin up as if we're startin up a parade
And everybody thinkin they get paid
But I don't really give a damn, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
on a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right

<SONGSTART>Dear Lord, I know You don't condone
The things I be doin' out here in these streets
And I hope that, I pray that You can overlook
The wrong that I had done in my life
I don't know no other way to survive out here
I got a whole bunch of people dependin' on me
Just walk with me, walk with me
Busslin' and gamblin', hit licks scramblin'
Bricks, I'm out here handlin', I'm pimpin' and I'm payin' the rent
Didn't choose this dirty game, this dirty game, it chose me
Every city love cocaine, they'll get it from him
If they don't get it from me
So I get cross-country with that thang
Makin' that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin' that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
'Cause I put up sum from every sale so all my children can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell
But just put me in woodgrain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that sweet down 'cause that bullshit don't apply to me
'Cause out here on the real streets a dreamer always stay sleep
'Cause out here the strong survive
And now they didn't die from thankin' weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it hard, still tryna get right with God
Still read my Bible lone 'cause Reverend do wrong, still livin' fraud
Tonight if I get down on my knees
And ask the Lord to forgive me, please
You thank He gon' hear me?
'Cause tomorrow I'm still gon' be slangin' ki's
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
See, I was born in the ghetto, manye, I was raised in the hood
And unless you lived it yourself, it just can't be understood
People think hustlin' is cool or hustlin' is live
They don't understand hustlers only hustlin' to survive
They wished they lived in the 'burbs, wished they didn't have to hang
Out on corners in low-income house in projects and slang
They wish their daddy was home, mama wasn't on drugs
And they didn't have to grow up to be dealers and thugs
Po' children got aspirations and dreams just like the wealthy
But it's hard when that environment you live in ain't healthy
You ain't givin' no hope, nobody showin' you pride
And you live with all this anger and frustration inside
Dog, don't let nobody tell you what you can or you can't do
Just 'cause they funky ass couldn't do it, they ain't you
You can be who you wanna be, live life how you feel
Just put your faith in the Lord, now that's keepin' it trill fo' real
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's
For all the niggaz in the game that's been slangin' cheese
For all them boys on them swangers and their fifth wheel
I'm out here riskin' my life, niggaz shife but I stay trill
I pray so much, I wonder if the Lord love me
I think He do but I'm so caught up in my thug deep
The feds bug me, followin' me around for three
Niggaz couldn't catch me so they hit me with conspiracy
You know that that's the other level of the game
Ain't got shit on me but some niggaz said my name
So here they come, they thang tight
They playin' shife, no Bun, givin' me life
I ain't goin' back, I'm a make 'em kill me
I'ma bust back, fuck the pen, you feel me?
Wish I can hug my momma and kiss my baby girl
I know it's a better place than livin' in this dirty world
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Some people win and some people lose
Some always cryin' the blues, yeah
Some people win, some people lose
Some always bein' misused
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
'Cause I need You, Lord, right now
I need You, right now
Need Ya, I need Ya, I need Ya
I need Ya 'cause I'm goin' and livin' too fast, yeah
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast

Trunk popped up screens fallin from the sky
Candy paint sprayed by eddie and im ridin on that glassy chrome
all courtesy of my hustle game
Real hustlin's in my blood line
I dont complain or whine
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make
a dime I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind but now i see that road to riches
Its a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs
I peep game from the best and since then i been playin chess
I put in work with no rest
To get that paper thats my quest
Im on the slow grind towards success
One of the best 'cause i keep it fresh

Gave the game "True Religion" before you found it in denim
Feel the, "Wrath of Kane, " and you could not escape
The hip-hop version of "The Ring" and you just watched the tape (Next up!)

Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band (rock band!)
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man (AOOOW!)
High roller dose some hoes on the cock plan
Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin cheese til the rubberbands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em "Hot Pants" (Next up!)
I make your girl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt

And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick
Comin direct from the Gentlemen's, full of that flint again
Live on stage fellas, this is Cinnamon
Fine, Black and feminine, I'm fin to win, look at the sin I'm in
Full of hallucinogens, me her and her friends
Now the venom in my snake, wanna poison
Come in with a brother and the boys and

We stuck it check it, we gots to keep em gettin bucked naked
Makin it soft, we keep these boppers takin it off

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

<SONGSTART>Use me up, I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin' my mind
I'm trippin' and I know it 'cause I'm all nerved up
'Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin' my car
And everyday it get better, I can't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin' she ain't nothin' but a scrub
But she make me feel high like I'm hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I can't help myself, I know that I'm trippin'
But she got it goin' on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my credit card
You know she get it 'cause ya know that
(Chill, C)
I know, G, I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin' pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin' aw'll limp
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and still ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin' good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin' out them duckets and them, croka sacks
And everybody wonderin' why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, ask me why I wanna dis her
I told her 'cause her lovin' ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin' out and Byrd say I'm trippin' too
But this time I just can't listen to my whole crew
'Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But ninety two came around and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
To sum it all up, I'm breakin' all my rules
'Cause she got me droppin' off her little brother to school
I be gettin' bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on sex
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food
UGK sayin' peace out, and plenty of luck
And she could keep usin' Pimp C, uh, just a use me up
Ah, hah, well oh, baby, baby, baby

Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch, holla at yo' bitch, now yo' bitch on my team
Got her buyin' us sticky green, lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch, you lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boyz, that's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today
Pro smoke, pro choke, anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take it, trick, I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya
Rollin' Seville

Marijuana fields

Grippin' my steal, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
They tellin' me, "Bun, don't go there", but man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas but scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout or smokin' that joint 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain, and leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em from P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em, wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em to hell, to heaven
I just spent 60 G's on a brand new Eldo-reeze
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac, north star fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke when my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch 'cuz I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant, '84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed down Screw tapes that knock, blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks, try 20 ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas
'N got big ass diamonds off in they teeth

Bitch, how you feel? Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel
Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play, it don't change, ain't a thang to say
It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go
Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers, body rockers
Late night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerrilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us
Touched like Midas, these bitch ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch ass niggas ain't got no cheese?
Blowin' big kill
(Blowin' big kill)
Million dollar deals
(Million dollar deals)
Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Uh, puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J
Smoke somethin', bitch

<SONGSTART>Well it's big Bun Beeda I built the track

It ain't nowhere fans a bunch with these sluts
Just shake your butts and bring back that stack (stack)
The mack is back and he's sittin on chrome
with a piece of chain or Herringbone or nugget (nugget)
That don't mean him a real live hoe
You ain't ready to roll then go on then, fuck it
Out them ducats, hoes better recognize
Niggaz better recollect, Bun finna regulate
I hit yo' town (what) find me a hoe stroll
Leave that bitch dry and head to another state (hold up)
Me and my brother can't wait when it come to the red
Cause we about that cash, cash
So if we can't convince ya we'll take your sister
Hit the highway and mash
You got, bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got, bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got, bitches that can and you got bitches that cain't
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch
Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care
I like the girl with the pussy hair
My partner Mike Mo like the pussy bare
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swang Big Dick, swang Sweet Jones
Go and get the myth out the cobra head
Girl got down you niggaz scared
I got a young yellow bitch, I'ma sing it loud
With a four-inch corner of jet-mink hair
Between her legs is where it great
And get the money out the nigga when she go on a date
I stay caked up, rocked up
Magnum rubbers stay socked up
I ain't tryin to get the wet dick
Hold my good but she ain't that slick
I know you want this high-dollar cum
Bitch know I got money, wanna get her some
Bitch you must, done lost your mind
The trick's niggaz over there, you better get on the grind
Bitches not flexin ain't much good
I should and I would keep clear if I could
But when I do I just CAWN'T get away
Cause I gotta fuck all day every day
That leaves me run loco for real
All these chickenheads lie about deal
Ain't gotta do it up to make me chill
Find a good spot on the floor and kneel!
Know that my heart's in between my fires
Though I can't take when they look in my eyes
Lookin for love that's no surprise
Comin up off, that's family ties
Then I hit it from the back, all the way
Slap that back and just lock cross say
Not freeze out without no delay
Girls in the chat, I ain't got shit to say

If you fittin' ta ride foreign, then, nigga, you gotta chop
And Southern niggas still got the nerve to ride D's
I ain't hatin' on Daytons, but it's 2000, nigga please
It's all about the candy paint, it's all about the Vogues
It's all about the slab, baby, it's all about the hoes
Got some cars and some pros some real and some fraud
Hated on by a nigga, hated on by a broad
So long as J's sell, and them boppin' hoes slut

I'm a heart attack, Cohesive
Some mean shit, I just don't talk cold
I mean shit Comin down like Denzel in the Hurricane
Feel like they're starting fires
And igniting flames, anything
To take down No Came down
Taken for a conviction of triple
Murder, Rubin Carter's life was murdered,
Just like a black man criticized for controversy
Sometimes I start my own, most lies do hurt me
Coming down like a homicide victim,
Just cause I look and sound different
Comin down like James Bond, I'm on another
Mission 005.7 like the rate of homicide victims
Violent crimes are hard to retire, they never Will
I am fucking legend even if I am killed
I'm still that potion, to put haters
In to the motion, Say I'm the reason
For most to believe in, Let's say I'm everything
And there's nothing in between me, I'm
Still the muthafucking shit
I know everything
I know two things
I know nothing
I still can't muthafucking quit
West 3
Comin up, all I wanted to
Be in high school was a jock
A homecoming king, a volley-
Ball player, a boxer, a rockstar, a Rodney King
But no rapper has me beat
An actor, a rocker, a baseball
Player, a professional wrestler
Similar to Brock Lesnar
Even a ladies man, a bodybuilder
Once again a boxer, a skilled dribbler
A debater, snowboarder
A triathlete, a break dancer
Now I hate dancing, a wake boarder
Even a cheerleader, more like
A peer mediator, Who am I
Where's my first breath
Took profound leaps in every step,
I was even into football, ob course
Basketball, bring it soccer, even tennis
Can't stop winning, it's addictive
Life is a game board until you finish it
Even a lifeguard, but I still can't swim
I know everything
I know two things
I know three things
I still can't muthafucking quit
3x
I'm distill the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga
I still in it nigga
I'm still the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga
I know everything
I know two things
I know nothing
I still can't muthafucking quit

No Came
Comin down with that distilled
Never loved, better hated
Bring it hated, lifestyle
Coming down, once in
A while, you get good shoes now
Comin down with disappointment
Life is a deadly appointment
But it's important, know that's true
What's the difference between me and you
Comin down with the major talk
What am I going to do after college
Before I graduate, bring it Morgan
State, Comin down like
Bobby Brown
Last name a color and a noun
I have to cool it now
But I never will
When the world is hotter than Mills
And I'm not talking Texas County
I'm talking I will punish you
If you befoul me
Start a riot, if you lying
I still can't quit
till song ends
I'm distill the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga
I still in it nigga
I'm still the shit nigga
I still can't quit nigga
I know everything
I know two things
I know nothing
I still can't muthafucking quit
It's great
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F**k it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C:)
Sweet jones
My bitch a choosey lover, never f**k without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like the f**k for 40 dollars in the club
f**king up the game, bitch you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Bun B:)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B U N B
Cause what's a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoes?
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get jones
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi:)
Eni mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-saw pole
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b**** is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, walk it off from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
I, I choose you baby

<SONGSTART>PA, TA and I keep yelling it but y'all don't hear me though
On the cool, I'm trying to tell them it be the place
That I be laying low, lamping in my hometown
Niggaz ain't trippin', so I gets to keep my chrome down
And I be dippin' around the spots that niggaz pass
Swisha's, serving to the fiends, calling me
Mr. Big Buns, snatching checks from your momma
Making dollars, hoes holla, hustling bring ya drama
Uh but I don't sweat it fool, I come from where the best ride
Ain't no punks where I'm from on that West side
PA nigga, outta town with big nuts
Where outta town motherfuckers lose they life on the cut
But we ain't trippin', pass that dipplin'
And it's gonna be all right, soon as I get fried tonight
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
Well, I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm smoking big fat dank
I don't fuck around no mo with that goddamn drank
But every time I get down with my nigga Big Mike
We go and get a bottle of that Dom all night
I got that green monster baby, can you buy that?
Plus I got Swisha suit for days, you wanna try that?
I roll them, most of them big and fat they look like ball bats
I live in P A T, the East side, niggas sayin' jack
These laws be trippin' 'cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it in cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living a Mac
And I ain't trippin', flippin' then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
'Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes

Got boppers that's steady jockin, goofy niggaz in my ear
Bitch I'ma self-made trillionaire, get your soft ass outta here
Weak niggaz wanna plead their case (case), just to raise up out my face (face)
I ain't got that time to waste, punch your mouth and knock out the taste
You MySpacin and Facebookin, playin games with them toys
I'm in the streets where gangstas meet, while you're online with them boys
So step your game up, build your name up, quit your talkin and quit your doin
All that planning and contemplating. when the f**k you gon' start pursuing?
Cars ain't driving themselves, mansions ain't building themselves
They waiting for Annie Mae and they need to stop feelin themselves
They wealth ain't comin until they earn it
But that somethin they won't know 'til they learn it, while burnin...
(Pimp C)
I'ma tell you pussy niggaz once again (once again)

<SONGSTART>Uhhhhhhhh ~!
If you know like I know you would get down on the flo'
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisha full of 'dro
We can get down for my dime and we can f**k, on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha f**kin with me fo'?
Every lady ain't a hoe and every hoe ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't f**k around with no punks
Ride with me she holdin a pistol while I'm whippin and poppin the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems 'long as she hear what the f**k I said
Pimpin ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here livin by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm lookin at you you choosin me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm superstar, we headed to the top
(Chorus: sung)
I'm stayin true, I'm out here whippin my Mercedes
F**kin with the midnight ladies - the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm bangin Screwwww, my young girl lookin fine
We stayin out here on the grind - and keepin money on our mi-ii-iind
(Bun B:)
Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, gotta feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster-ass persona so hard it can dent, steel
In the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leakin fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust

Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leakin out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you gotta go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Gotta pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Gotta play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's yo' turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a f**k how you feel
(Chorus)
(Pimp C:)
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the SOOOOOOOOOUTH
This scary hoe don't wanna know what it's ABOOOOOOOOUT
Cause I stay country true down to the co', dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws, feel it tighten up don't stop don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars, f**k the D.A. f**k the law
I f**k the snow but I love a pro like flatbackers I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer, drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker, bitch around me man I'ma mack her
(Bun B:)
From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of 'dro and Impala bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki', and ten kilos grams in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's one point five mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is tickin, time is pressin
No second guessin, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK
(Chorus)
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S H O R T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be living naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell
I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fucking maker
'Cause I ain't taking, no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts
Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch
This dope ain't yo dope and these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafucking guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafucking road
And don't even try to come back nigga, yo
'Cause me Dre and C got fingers on a fat trigger
We making too much money moving weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper booming cold blow yo ass up
And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailing on yo bitch ass
But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas
Niggaz on the track dropping shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cooking up some llello for the local drug king
The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slanging some more white dust
Real, oh, so trill, the life's no glamor
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fucking up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home
And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales
Stupid muthafuckas smoking dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fighting Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops finding my stash, yo what could the worst be
Through so going undercover then turning dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Calling my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas
I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't 'bout to sell no fucking dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope but you still ain't selling shit
Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon' let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafucking cuts
So step in like I said before, we'll take them muthafucking nuts
Ask the last nigga brought his fucking ass down
Trying to sell that fucking dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'm a go to Port Arthur and run them fucking niggaz
Brought his fucking gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac
Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope
Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
'Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafucking killas
So have your shit attached, before you come check us
Pimp C, bitch, P.A. home, Short Texas

Roll like a stone, like my name Mick Jagger

<SONGSTART>[Intro: Pimp C]
UHH...
Dedicated to all the underdogs, knahmtalkinbout?
Muthafuckas told me I wasn't gon be shit...
Told me I was gon be able to do this rap shit...
Knahmtalkinbout? My own family talked down on me, knahmsayin?
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (My uncle told me I wasn't gon be shit)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (I used to walk around with a bag full of rappers)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
(Motherfucker told me, a nigga from Texas couldn't make no record)
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
(Then after I made the record, muh'fuckers said they would never give us no respect)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... (But now they tryna rap like us)
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah... (Tryna be like us, tryna smell like us)
(Knahmtalkinbout?)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money... (Check this out)
[Pimp C:]
Man I refuse to let the bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up, but they cain't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a hoe open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a hoe for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
(right... right...)
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (hmm...)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (hmm...)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho...
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money...
[Pimp C:]
To all the babies havin babies on ya' own
I know you feelin fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, "Ya fucked up your life"
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy with lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggaz tellin you, "Ya crazy"
"What you thankin? You too young to have a family"
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggaz ain't gon ride witchu
But get down with that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin
It's time to change sumthin...
[Chorus]
[Pimp C:]
If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, "It ain't enough room in the NBA"
You tell them haters, "Save that bullshit for another day"
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, "You ain't gon make it", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase to hog it up, the lawyer end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be shame and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right...
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
... (Uh!)

They call me Mick Jagger 'cause I 'Roll a lot of stones'
It's a whole lot of clones but only one Sweet Jones
Turnin' whores to carnivores, they just can't leave my meat alone
It's been a long time since I busted on a glock
But every corner that I hit, I left it screwed up and chopped
Marooned up and dropped, like my Biarritz on top
Let the motherfucker bleed until it drip and let it drop
I'm still that young boy that had a pocket full of stones
But now I'm sick and simply rich, grippin' wood and flippin' chrome
I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key

Man I pull up in your city and get my Bush on
Lay down the competition, take their cash crops and get my push on
Moved up to Bentley with more chrome from a Lexus key
All because we cornered the market on that Texas tee
And we don't bar no plexes, we way bigger than other men though
The diamond deuces on tinted windows, we in the wind yo
We 'Chevro way' the wind blow, that's the corner we been Joe
Don't know where you been bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though
When it's ten fo', good, but in my Styrofoam good and muddy
We block bleeders, leavin' your neighborhoods good and bloody
We grippin' that woodler, bud it, sit back and scope it
Pay attention to Prince and pushin' everything about to pump it

Uh, I done smashed up my flyin' spurt, it wasn't shit
I just parked it in the grass and brought some brand new shit
A Phantom Rolls Royce, 24's with the bump
I ain't trippin' about the seat, I got them woofers in my trunk
Cut in my swisher, codeine on my whiskers
Fuckin' with that Smoke D, Bundy and that Vicious
UGK Records, it's an institution
Know a lot of niggaz livin' off of prostitution
Pimpin' ain't dead, it just moved to the web
Bitch ain't gotta hit the track, ain't gotta give no tricks no head
Ain't got to give no tricks, no pussy, just cameras and screams
Easiest money you can get, it's the American Dream bitch
Man I'm a middle finger figure, a million dollar mission
Poppin' like Orville Redenbacher, with a whippin' in the kitchen
Yayo like Dontrelle Willis, we the trillest on the mound
I'm holdin' that whole South down, I know you feel us
We the realest walkin' the planet
Can't stand it, pass away, wanna fight us
Start to swingin', wanna kill us, blast away, wanna stab us
Get to stickin but make sure you cut us deep
'Cause I betcha we comin' back a couple hundred brothers deep
Pimp and Bun, we run the streets, which streets? Man, pick your hood
Don't matter, we represented, cross us? We gon' get you good
Them Down South veterans, ain't nobody better than

Lookin good spendin some nigga G's
Nails by Vietnamese, [unverified], lookin' like they worth G's
Dress above they knees, jellies and G-strings up the ass
Man I never let 'em pass
So, tell me where can I find 'em
With they nigga or in that candy Cadillac right behind him
Bitches tellin' me see yo' dick grand
All she wanna do is ride Su-bur-ban
Put her ass on the leather and rub the wood
See we got boppers in Texas oh, man that pussy look good
So, I let them hoes ride and I show them a grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
When she told me I looked good I didn't feel no pride
All the bitch wanted to do is just fuck my ride
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car

An attribute put up in they head by they momma
Oh yeah, I'ma tell it like it is, I sees how it goes down
Niggaz talkin' 'bout, how they passin' these hoes 'round
But y'all trickin', them hoes told me
Fools y'all ain't Goldy, ridin' in a goodie but an oldie
Fifty dollars there, a hundred dollars here
You brought the bitch a drink and all her homegirls a beer
Your homeboys lookin for ya, but yo' ass gone
You left your niggaz at the club and took all them hoes home
And didn't even fuck, man what the fuck
If you didn't want to fuck then get the fuck up out the truck
You know what I mean? I ain't showin out Vogues
Just so these hoes can be seen, c'mon you wanna fuck or cut?
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
When you look at my chrome and you lick your lips
It's just like I'm rubbin' my dick between your hips
And when you smile and shake your ass, my grill smile right back
Bitch I'm the real, that's why I ride Cadillac
And I'ma fuck you and fuck all yo' friends
Soon as Pimp C come through in that 600 Benz
With burgundy paint, butter and LG rims
Color TV, VCR playin X-rated films
Of myself, runnin up in beauty queens
But let me tell y'all niggaz the difference between y'all and me
You see, man I can tell all that bitch wanted to do
Is just ride for free and smoke for free
But bitch not me, you better ask them hoes if my name Pimp C
Unless your pussy makin ten thousand dollars a week
The only way I see you sittin in my passenger seat, you bitch!

i'm comin' down gulf way, i'm tryin' to see what's up
i see big ass and some titties
now we flippin' in the 'bourbon to the city
the attitude's shitty but i bought no plex
ain't talkin' 'bout the malcolm but i'm ridin' on the x
the highway was so wet, i'm slippin' out my lane
the bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
i bet you never seen a big truck like that
i bet you never got a dick sucked like that
the bitch didn't know that i was tapin' the whole scene
now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen
the glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
i got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
tryin' to close me down, but i got ghetto love
i'm pimp c bitch, i'm comin' down richer than rich
so bitch you know you gotta gimme good stuff
Chorus:
Lookin' for that good stuff

Verse 2 (bun-b):
We flippin' worldwide, p.a.t. international jetsetters
bigger than the hollywood letters
but don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
breakin' off the jealous with pitch black barettas

bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex
like you major boy you have done played yourself

a one-way ticket to something bigger than you
over your head and got scared

busta playa moves and if you done it and did it
as i sit in the lap of luxury

undercover motherfucker tried to sell drugs to me
what could be more throw
mafioso puttin' bombs under my load
never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
now i'm comin' down shinin'
pieces and chains full of diamonds
i'm winin' and dinin' and caligula
pretty boys gettin' off the hook
bitches sayin' but i'm diggin' ya
but i know that make ya mega crunk
and make ya make it man it make a niggas wanna pop trunk

like a mobster and gots to be lookin' for the good stuff

<SONGSTART>Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
[Chorus:]
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin-swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
[Pimp C:]
When the top starts fallin the bitches start callin
My trunk start bangin and the fo's start crawlin
The drank mixed up, in the cream soda bottle
Her lips, hit my dick that's why I smashed on the throttle
Swisha Sweet candy, Robert Davis in my cup
I'm swervin like Bootsy but I couldn't give a fuck (fuck)
You see this car? (You see this car?)
You see this truck? (You see this truck?)
They both for me now watch them girls get buck (buck)
Ain't shit friendly but we still have fun (fun)
UGK for life, you know the Pimp and the Bun (Bun)
The great state of Texas, candy in the Lexus
Dick for them hoes jaws, pistols for the flexers
Somebody asked me why I'm ridin on the East
All I did was told the truth, the bullshit niggaz cease (cease)
If you ain't hatin nigga why the fuck you mad?
If your records ain't sellin, get your fingers out ya ass, bitch!
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Well it's the king of the trill (trill) wood wheel in my palm (palm)
Yeah I'm sittin sideways on suedes smokin that bomb (bomb)
The granddaddy kush mixed with a little O.G. (fo' sho')
That's my breakfast, off top I gotta blow three
Not to mention codeine, liquid and the pill (pill)
Bloats on my grill with my hand on my steel (steel)
Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing
I'ma gon' and pop the trunk, surely but slowly
Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your Colby Jet system (no)
Your slab ain't holdin, ain't no use to you frontin
And I'm fin' to shut the game down when I push the button
And the... [echoes]
[Chorus]
[Cory Mo:]
Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang
Cory Mo about to do the damn thaaaaang
In the butter guts with the diamond in the back
King Kongs in the trunk, hit the switch and watch it crack
I'ma let my paper stack and quote nothin but facts
So don't "ax" me nothin partner 'less you droppin some cash (cash)
Now she hoppin it fast (fast) that's just how I like it (like it)
Turn around and show me somethin girl I'm gettin excited (oooh)
Ain't nobody trippin cause the money already made
I done said it befo', so I'ma say it again
And let my top drop dowwwwwn
[Chorus]
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>It all started with a Pimp C, bitch
So what the fuck is up?
Told 'em somethin' good
Ease up my muthafuckin' cut
'Cause if you don't really wanna fuck wit a trill nigga
From the trill villa wit a steel trigga land of the real killers
Pop pop muthafucka there you go
I'ma bust 'em on yo ass if you don't ease up off me ho
'Cause trill niggas don't carry no sugar in they nutsac
Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack
So you gon' give me my money but you don't hear me though
But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes
P.A. nigga, trill ass nigga
How you figga you can buck me down nigga?
Mr. big an, Mr. big time, give me what's mine
Instead of buying cars for a bitch named sunshine
Give me what's mine, give me what's mine
Before it come down to triggas
Shit, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Bitch, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Uh, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
But you can't hear me
It's the return of the trill ass niggas bitch
Yea muthfuckas, I figured you run
I figured you run, when I pull triggas to guns
That triggas to guns P.A. fool a nigga named Bun
A nigga named Bun, no more sun, no more shine
Say hello to the nine milly millameter
(Buck, buck, buck)
Money tight glock, bustin' them shots
When I break yo ass off somethin' hot
Niggas steady catchin' lead to the head
I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin' bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin', niggas start passin' away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise, I'm gettin' Chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now it's the return of the trill ass niggas

Dope boys hangin' on the corners and the benches
Sayin' it's a drout so it's plenty of heat pinches
Boy, used to come up from the rags to the riches
Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches
But now it's like the game is full of nothin' but some snitches
And wanna be gangsters that's scared to put 'em in ditches
Fed's takin' pictures so the cameras go click
And video rollin' while I'm holdin' my dick
They follow me around like they doin' they job
But while you watchin' me how many people gettin' robbed
Lets keep it trill 'cause we already know
What it already is and how it already go
That's why we chop blades comin' down real slow
Pop trunks, swang, riders slam Cadillac door
Pass the swisha let's blow
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Before we get started, every body roll up one for Pimp C
Before we go any further, take your lighter, light it up for me
Now let's go, now let's go and all the girls get down on the floor
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
I'm whippin' big wheels, whippin' big wheels
Hope your drink don't spill whippin' big wheels
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel
lady on my side, hey
And if you all down for me
Put your hands in the air raise 'em up for Pimp C
And if you all down with me
Put your hands in the air raise 'em up for Pimp C

These other broads hatin on her, if they sick they need to throw up
She got class and panache with precision
Picture perfect in my vision and I done made a decision
That I'm tired of wishin, get down with the Bun and Pimp and
You could roll with the playas on the million dollar mission, c'mon
Uhh, hey mama, I'm a tell you what the deal is
I like your style, I like how you handle your business
You ain't out here trippin chasin boys in showbiz
You're confident, you out here puttin it down for yo' kids
I don't care 'bout no nigga, he don't concern me
He ain't teachin you nothin, you need to learn me
Check out my mind, I'm 24 on the grind
I got the key to the streets, I got a open line
And I don't get caught up in "he say, she say"
And I don't chase the cat, I keep the P play
I wouldn't holla if I ain't thought you was ready boo
I know you feelin me, cause girl I'm feelin you
Ooh baby (ooh baby)

Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up now
Yeah she a bad mamma-jamma, a brick, house
Still I fits, out, cause she thick, stout
With the feminine fat, in all the right places
She look me in my eyes and she make all the right faces
Cause she's a real catch, we make a tough pair
A true dynamic duo and we up there
We sittin tall at the top
And if she ride or die for me playa I'm a give her all that I got
I break her off and not, let her hold the keys
I don't take her out of town, man I take her oas
It ain't trickin if you spend it on your lady
Bring the bacon home to baby and everything'll be gravy
Just let me know if that's soundin like a plan
Cause all you really need to change your life is the man
And you appealin to the King of the Trill and
I just wanna know if you're feelin me like I'm feelin, you

<SONGSTART>(feat. 3-2)
[Bun B]
A bad day for the niggaz in my click
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It's seems the drug situation is so tow up
And poes down the fuckin T-X had to show up
I got shit on the scene so 99 can't hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret and there's no rest
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
In Dynasties.I-ROCs... and Caravans and muthafuckas are swolen
Like paper stacks and a rubberband
Goin all out of tact on the local bird slaggin brothaman
And be servin as slow as fuck
Cause my niggaz are nervous
and if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggaz is happy with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town
Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my tags off my buick and yall know I didn't love that
Rollin on some white balls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, YOU GOTS TO DO YOUR OWN NAILS!
I told my niggaz to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town
God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back up!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my click
Got the birds, and reopen my lab back up
And told my boys, "If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye,
Don't give him a chance to identify!"
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at random, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Close to the dopeman - God damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
CAUSE IN MY YARD IS A BIG ASS - I GOT YALE SIGN!
It's time for TONY MONTANA stacks
I got niggaz on the corner holdin big ass bags and cans of crack
The land of Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fools run in with your glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last love
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight lights
when the feds in town
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

Comin' down on the slab, boy
Ridin' dirty, for real tho, ridin' dirty
Have you ever been rollin' in a clean ass 'Lac
Blowin' big out the window, everybody got a sack
Got my heat right between my seat, got a box of them thangs
In case these fools start playin' with me
You'd be surprised how them boppers wink, girl, I can't stop
Give my headlights a blink and roll them up out the top
And keep movin' and keep rollin'
Fools that don't be holdin' I'm comin' through and foldin'
And I can't stand snitches, wanna kill all of y'all
Even though some bustas fall I'm still rollin' like a ball
And having things my way, hittin' that highway
Sellin' that big yay, a plush-ass place to stay
Police, they wanna run in
Talkin' on cell phones got a lotta kids done in
I wanna live like Arnold, Willis and Mr. Drummond
And keep my paper sturdy, big birds and tight herbs
Fool, I'm ridin' dirty
Big birds and tight herbs, fool I'm ridin' dirty
Ridin' dirty, fool, ridin' dirty
Tell me can you feel it? Man, nothin' can save ya
I believe it's that season for gettin' yo papers
Or haven't you heard about them birds? We call it that cheese
In Texas we get it with ease, hit I-10 if you please
But these polices, they think they sharp as creases
For no reasons, man, they straight up strippin' cars to pieces
Out of suspicion or if they thinkin' you on a mission
Ain't no wishin' or prayin', they sayin' assume the position
Hands behind ya head, down on ya knees
You get the case and they get yo weight and yo G's
Come on, I use to ride the Port Arthur city streets
With a chick with pretty feets and a box of Philly Sweets
They tried to finish me but couldn't get it done
So somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty
Man, somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty

<SONGSTART>[Pimp C:]
One with a trigger, two with a bat
Three big brothers, fo' - wanna squab with me
So I guess a brother gotta throw
Tell 'em like this, ya better get up out my camp dude
Befo' I have to pull my gat and get, real rude
I don't figure that it's worth gettin hurt
Just 'cause ya gal wanna give me that skirt
Bet it feels funny when ya doin 69
Knowin that ya sippin on all my jimmy wine
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bad
Knowin that ya swallowed all the skeeter that I had?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda shot you up instead I told ya somethin good
[Chorus: sampled from Chaka Khan & Rufus' "Something Good"]
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah... yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
[Bun B:]
Aiyyo, what's up with that bulge in ya khakis?
You wanna pack a gat, but you STILL ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gangload of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cause by yourself, you're runnin to the flo'
I seen your kind befo', man ya nothin with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin when ya chillin with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin up some daisies
See crazy you wanna be, but punks with no heart, they ain't hard
They just waitin for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep your weak self locked in ya hood
Cause without your boys I'm a have to tell ya somethin good
[Chorus]
(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)
[Pimp C:]
Brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check ya girl and what she did in the past
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her REAL fast
But I don't trust the dugout, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check ya blood and let somebody check your teeth
But if you don't step, I'm a drop on ya fast
And pump off bullets like government cash
I didn't do ya girl but your sister was alright
Took her to my homeboy's Caddy last night [girl moaning in the background]
She waxed my jimmy, and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit if from the back, and the girl just THREW ME
Told me, "Pump it harder, " and she scratched me on my BOOTY
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty lil' girl
[Chorus 1/2]
[Bun B:]
Let's talk about these half-n-half punks
By day they sorry bastards, at night they talkin bout, poppin trunks
Butter .25 cain't keep you alive
From a sawed-off, fool so I hope you survive
See bluffin might save ya tail one day
But who's ta say, it won't catch ya next week, on the runway?
You might shoot a few shots in the wind
But the same time tomorrow, you'll be runnin again
Now can you keep it up, every damn night?
You steady runnin to the argument but runnin from the fight
What's the deal man? Why don't you take your Raiders cap off?
Cause one of these days, you gonna getcha head slapped off
You cain't keep a crew cause they gettin sick of seein you bail
Like a punk'll hit the backstreet trail
And the women don't like you cause ya act like them
And that's why your little jimmy never went fo' a swim
Ya talk about slangin, makin G's
But I saw a fiend chase ya from, BJ's up to Mickey D's
Now everyday punks get took
Either for they dough, they'll ride 'em for the powder that they cook
You bookin from the scene cause ya couldn't hold ya own
A 40 ounce bottle slams, ya dead to your dome
Now you want revenge, so ya get your automatic
Find a group of hard-heads, and startin kickin static
Ya pulled ya little chrome but these fools got gats
Try to run and caught two buckshots in ya back
Now you nothin but a memory that's gone in a slayin
So when I tell you somethin good, punk I don't be playin

<SONGSTART>(feat. Kool Ace, Too $Hort)
[Pimp C:]
(Uh, Uh) One time for yo' muthafuckin'...(whuut)
Back, bitch (uh)...Kool Ace (whuut), UGK...(huh)
[Chorus: Pimp C]
Pimpin' ain't no illusion,
And pimpin' ain't never died.
Mo' pimps was on that heroin
And yo' pimp tripped out on that fry.
The dikes done came through
And straight threw off all the game;
Got all these hoes thinkin'
They could manage they own change.
[Kool Ace:]
But it ain't no illusion,
I know... you all have witnessed
He rollin' in my Caady mo'
Wit' fly bitches,
Makin' ole deals: Now, ho (huh, huh)
Ain't Bob Barker
But I'm caught up in this game
Mo' like... Peter Parker.
P-I-M-P, take the P's that I am.
I want you payin' hoes in my army
Like... uh... Uncle Sam,
And we gon' jam...
I'm talkin' 'bout the world greatest show
I know my shit is extreme
But I'm all about them does.
When I'm steppin' on the scene
Be there four deep... hella clan
My reality is your favorite dream
(Stop that shit, daddy...)
Best believe Kool Ace gon' keep it real.
Pimp C & Bun B to testify for the ear
Excuse me, y'all, but this about Southern shit.
Now, tell me can you... uh... feel this, bitch?
We givin' 'em brain contusions...
Pimp C, what's the conclusion?
[Pimp C:]
Pimpin' ain't no illusion...
[Chorus: x2]
[Pimp C:]
Pimpin' ain't dead... nigga, it just began
(How the fuck you know Sweet Jones?)
My hoes still out there sellin' ass.
Yo' bitch is out of pocket,
'Cause yo' pimpin' was scary;
Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy.
Fuck niggas watch them mack and pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what y'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'.
This is the conclusion: pimpin' ain't no illusion.
[Chorus: x2]
Bun B:
If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her,
'Cause a beggar ain't a muthafuckin' chooser.
Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean.
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a wif a this...
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior... and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny... sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again... that's why...
[Chorus: x2]
Too $hort:
You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money... it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game.
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it.
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin'...beeyatch.
[Chorus: x3]
...pimpin' ain't no illusion
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part."
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it"
"Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets"
"Had to tie her to a rocket"
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up"
"Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up"
"(Shit)"

If he keeps talkin' shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you tryin' to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the South
For them niggas and them girls with them golds in they mouth

It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game

And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters

Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that
There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?"
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution

And keep a player paid in full cause pimping ain't no joke
You want to pop that pussy that's a slim ass chance
Put the paper in the panties when you get that dance
This C.O.D. nigga, so you can keep your nuh plastic cards
No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers
But why slap us when you think a nigga down on his luck
You try and flag us when you see us coming down in a buck

I don't stunt and blow smoke up your ass baby
But don't be acting all saditty with class baby
You with a nigga such as my self it'll cost you
So pay before a nigga fuck around and be the tosser
Sweet Jones, gripping grain
With all that shit you talk ain't got no bezatine chain
And most of y'all niggaz ain't nothing but tricks
But we sipping lean and breaking bricks
Popping pills, work the wood wheel
Fuck where you're from and fuck how you feel

Balling down on Beale Street
Sipping on a pint of syrup
Chopping up the chronic weed
Picking all the fucking seeds

In my trunk I got them fucking keys
Always riding Chevy things
Shining on them twanky things
Kids I'm a role model
Police I'm a dope man
Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead
Never has it left my mouth
Optimos a fifth of crown
Red eyes with a frown
Niggaz with them gold teeth
Fast talking on the town

Knot in my right pocket
Left pocket got them rubbers
Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash

Run up on me with that first, will leave you stinking in the grass
If your calico to mask, if you Baptist go to church
See a hoe up in a nigga, gon pull up a skirt

Niggaz scheming on my bezel, on some devilish shit
I been to hell and back, on another level you bitch
Go on try it I'm going live, they gon need a shovel for you bitch
I been stabbed I been shot, went from no fans to being hot
But somehow always fall short, for trying to keep fiddles in my pot
In a dog eat dog world, y'all fellas be chasing girls
When I place myself in history, too hot for a ladder to catch me
But I can't help but to notice, I'm one of the coldest
And I know y'all haters love when I'm locked up, but I won't lose focus
Yeah I wrote this counting down, how many days I got
So lately my gun ain't been hid, it's been displayed a lot
My attitude is fucked up, I don't give a fuck cause I just don't give one
Thinking bout living a life where everything you do right is wrong, mo'fucker I live one
I know niggaz wanna kill me, but I'm still riding pride
Cause the Lord riding with me, and that's the main reason why
Some niggaz win, and some niggaz lose
Some niggaz getting bruised, some always crying to blues
Some niggaz already lost, and ain't gon lose no mo'
Big shoes hoe choose, ain't paying dues no mo'
Everything y'all trying to do, I built a school hoe
Now it's fly to talk country, I made the rules hoe
I was sagging in my khaki's, 'fore Dickies cool
Gangsta Nike's on my feet, our music banging in the streets
The young B.G.'s, really love to thump
Fuck radio and BET, I'm out here bumping in the trunk
For the girls popping pussy, and the boys with the blow
Cadillac'ers and flat-backers, I'm out here repping for it hoe
Can't any man, boy or woman take away my soul
It's a gift given from God, and I'm keeping a tight hold
The world is ugly and cold, trying to make me the same
But I'ma keep it one hundred, when it come to the game
Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up
We keep it click tight, so when niggaz start lurking
In the dark heaters start, anybody start jerking
Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg
A dragging society, don't borrow don't beg
For tomorrow so gon 'head with your pity, I'ma be cool
Kindergardeners was looking up to me, in pre-school
Down with Pimp C fool, and P-A-T the town
Representing it to the fullest, till I'm gone I hold it down
Bun Beater, would never sell you no lie
So if you ask for the truth, I'ma reply to trill niggaz don't die

Pimp C in the house y'all, put your hands together
Big Dick Cheney and Snowy Snow, (cocaine cocaine)
(Pimp C:)
Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggaz, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'ma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose
Cocaine, cocaine
(Bun B:)
They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Columbia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine
(Rick Ross:)
You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
And my yayo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

You niggaz actin like a broad, I don't wanna fight
Nah I ain't gon' squab but I will have a gun fight
We finna hit the streets with the glock, with the G's in the block
Trappin on like a traffic stop, then sooner or later I have a knot
Got money from Bankhead to Groverland, fuck your head back to Simpson Road
Down South fakers known for gettin paper
then some of the hill niggaz still know, for sho' they know
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>[Bun B]
Yeah, 976-Bun B
That new shit for ninety-two
All you niggaz peep this one
Check it out
Aiyyo, trill was the last one nigga, this time you better pull a gat
Cause the dick's hangin low, and it's still fat
But ain't shit whack so you better pull a quick guard
This shit is live enough to make your MOMMA'S dick hard
(C'mon!) Pick up ya phone and dial the 7 numbers that makes ya trip
for live shit comin from Bun B's lips
And I'm givin hoes the sensation of a big-ass nut
gushin out, be in tele-cum-munications
Nine-seven-six, two-eight-six-two
Courtesy of Bun B, straight to motherfuckin you
Yo, the nigga was trill, same shit, new place
[?] [?], then bust in your face
Yeah niggaz be trippin yo, but still in the meanwhile
Your girl keeps callin me on motherfuckin redial
Now you're swoll cause your bitch runs your bill up
You catch me at the mo-tee, Bun big bone a fill' up
She might be shit to you, cause dude give her pay G
But pussy get played out, and pussy comes daily
As long as your game be strong ain't no thang
My phone always rang cause of the dope shit I sang
Keepin hoes on my dick yo, and ain't no lettin go
The net keeps flyin out, the pussy stays wet so
I turn on my VCR then I put a flick in
The hoe starts lickin that dick and pretty soon
I'm stickin that ass, like a fool in the bed
All I can see, is the top and back of your head
It ain't about conversation or make that hit
On a first name basis hoe that ain't bout shit!
Look trick, tell me how many rubbers to pack
I hit the room from the front, the ass from the back
And yo it ain't about the phone call, this about the nut'n
So let me bust a fat load on your bellybutton
See, quiet storm done put a notch on your belt
And when it's over, I don't wanna hear how it felt
I'm just pullin off my rubber, takin a bath
Gettin dressed to reminisce of how I cut ya in half
It's all in the day of an Underground fool
So dial the digits and I'm divin in that ass like a pool
But when I get wet BITCH, I won't be drownin
I clown on hoes to leave their pussyhole frownin
Or if you bitches wanna hear some more of this
Lock your bedroom door trick, pick up your cordless
You can suck a mean dick, lick a good ball
And if I keep on fuckin, you'll keep on callin
And I'll be playin you, when you think you'll be playin me
It's just pussy games with some help from AT&T
So if you need a dick to be real friendly
Dial nine-seven-six, B-U-N-B, bitch!

Like my syrup and swisha can't leave without it when I ride
Even though I'm the king of the city where I reside
I wouldn't and couldn't do it without my woman on my side
Sometimes I got it figured out, sometimes I'm confused
I win 9 times out of 10 but now and then I might lose
But no matter the road I choose and how the drama unfold
A playa always got his better half right on his shoulders
She gon' hold me down to the fullest, rainy or sunny
She seen me ball out of control and dead broke with no money
So when the game got funny, she ain't pack up and roll
She help me get back on my feet now man that's way too cold
If you got a down woman wit'chu keepin' it true
Don't try to hate, appreciate her for the things that she do
This dedicated to the dedicated ladies that stand up
If you keep it real wit your man then put your hand up, c'mon

And my name became yo' back tattoo
I love the fact that you don't need me to make you whole
Doin' it fast or takin' it slow, you know when to let me take control
And I apologize for puttin' tears inside them eyes
When I wasn't fair didn't compromise
Put you in fear when I told them lies
How I love to dive inside them thighs I love your cockiness
Ain't gonna ask if you roll in rap you know this right it's obvious

So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F*** it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that b**** do you dirty
we'll wipe her a** out and send detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C)
Sweet jones
My b**** a choosey lover, never f*** without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for 40 dollars in the club
f***** up the game, b**** you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them b****es too scary
Your b**** chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Bun B)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
Because its greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
Im a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar b****
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C & B U N B
Cause whats a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoe
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose
OOOooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi)
Eeny mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl dont touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the C-Support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers couldn't stop the
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last pump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooooohhhhh Ooooooohhh

Let me do what I wanna do let me do what I feel

Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin' crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper I gotta do it quick
Thinkin' I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin' wit, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live everyday like it's my muthafuckin' last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'ma die
But if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'ma take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say, "It'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
This world we livin' in man it ain't nuthin' but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya in New York niggas gettin' shot fo bombers
Now they got yo life in the former they in like California
Niggas wit dubs are hydroponic, marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pops died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wished it was twice mayn
I remember bein' eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not givin' a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' to the end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen fo damn near ten
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day you here but the next day you gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
I'm up early 'cuz ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets Peanut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin' shife, so shife back
Can't show no weakness wit these bitches life jacked
Mayn it's a trip where I stay especially for me
Them bitches tryin' to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga down in Florida Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I ain't no liar
My man BoBo jus' lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God why he let these killas live
And take my homeboy's son away
Man if you got kids show 'em you love 'em
'Cuz God jus might call 'em home
'Cuz one day you're here, the next day you're gone
I know, you know, well, well, yeah
La ra la ra, I know, yeah, yeah

These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that
Who's says he's going through a thang
When ya'll ain't never lied
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
When I hurt and try to hate 'cause she knows the thrill is gone
Say man, I stop smokin' with haters back in ninety four
But niggas thinkin' that a sweeps gone get the through my door
And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye to eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good

I see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight
And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this away
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away
My dead homey momma's tear shit
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 503
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets just keep on gettin' live with me
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin' that
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains
It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to ESG and all the victims of the game
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.

I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I'm pimpin' through the ave. tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown, when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuck 'n' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good

Mashin from the scene almost crashin, flashin
Cop lights keep a player dashin
Cash-in, on the crack course, paper stashin
With a passion for high-priced fashion
My dang clothes and my eighty-fo's clanky
God thank ye, motherfuckers actin cranky

<SONGSTART>Hi life
We livin' that hi life
Hi life
We livin' that hi life
I'm tired livin' f**ked up, tired of livin' bad
Tired of grandmama telling me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm tryin to live up to the image
That she would want me to be
But I got one foot in the street and every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G but Niggas depend on me
It ain't fake to hit a 10 so niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushing cocaine niggas holding pistols
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20, 000 tryin' to turn it into a hundred, and ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas came to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch thinking she can ease my mind by suckin' my dick
Bitch make up for a minute cause that ship never last
In 1996 niggas is dyin' from layin' on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Easy-E died
And you be wonderin' why you niggas
Out there smokin'cri
I wish that I could tell y'aIl wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that nigga you know that I would be lyin'
And I been f**kin' pussy since the tender age of nine
It's gettin' to be a full-time job just tryin' to stay alive
And crack a scandalous smirk offended by the weed
Smoke comin' of my shirt
But I still put in work and front for my folks
'cause where I come from nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe
Some say that nigga's sellin' dope
And you know I ain't lyin' that just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the devil poke you
With his fork
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophet, f**kin' hoes
And gettin' paid
I'm looking for that
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life
You only got one life to live that's all they give us to do it
You could bullshit your way through it or stay true
It can be complicated cause niggas
Be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the people
In the lane get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive, take your positions
With pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dust
To see the only stretch rest see how we was left to be
Down these streets that we be on
Motherf**kers sleepin' on them corners that you be on
Probably because society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the f**k made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas sellin' that dank
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of the American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on who gives a damn
When you can't afford a turkey or ham
Livin' off of Ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab, it's far from me
To push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your man
And so instead of being without I'm hustlin' tryin' to
Get through these ungodly days
Thinkin' of ways to get the f**k out of this maze
A man'll commit a crime who the& f**k it crime pays
I'm goin' through a phase you don't go out until you
Out reason a motherf**ker
Gots to pour out this 40 on the curb, disturbed and
Left with no doubt in this mind
But still sometimes he don't know why he walkin' around just hopin'
He can get one more try to make it
It's a bullshit he goin' through but yo he gots,
You can't fake it to get the
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life

But the game been good to meeeee...
UHH, first album went platinum, now you can't go gold
Made ya deal with the devil, but you sold yo' soul
You rent a lotta cars, rent a mansion and them hoes
You say you sold your Phantom, bitch they took yo' Rolls
Get disrespected everywhere you go
Big bodyguards when you come for the shows
They already know you got shit on your name
Nigga, you a pussy, they gon' take yo' chain
Take yo' piece, rings and watch
You play rich, boy you need to stop
I ain't dissin nobody, no particular name
Ya shoe fit nigga, get the fuck up out the game - lil' BITCH!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
I'm a Down South MC, I'm cold on the mic
I say it how I feel and I do it how I like
I write what I see, what I do, and what I know
And keep it one hundred off top from the do'
Now whether at a show, in the booth, or on the street
No matter where I go and no matter who I meet
Everybody tryna tell me how they feel 'bout the South
On the cool, them haters need to shut they fuckin mouth
'Cause we grip grain, nigga we pop trunk
We to' straps and we ready for the funk
Some niggaz two-step, some niggaz dance
Some niggaz just ball wit' a bottle in they hands
Sell a couple ringtones niggaz, that's bread
You hatin on paper get that FUCK up out yo' head
Worryin 'bout my cheese, getcha own stack
It's goin down in the South, you don't like it
Click clack, motherfucker!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
You got caught with that work on 10
Made a deal with the state to turn your foul partner in
But he took 15, befo' you could tell
He ain't witchu no mo' hoe, you got twenty in a cell
I sent you a lawyer, you ain't listened that time
Ain't no appeal, but they dropped it to five?
Who you had to fuck to give back that time?
Textin me from a cell phone - bitch, yo lost YO' FUCKIN MIND?
How dare you tryna get me on conspiracy, Jack?
If the feds hit me, I'ma hit yo' ass BACK!
You fight witcho tounge, I send 'em killa
Transcript writer, I'll kill you nigguuuh!

"Got front and back, and side to side"
(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush inside ? ? is fresh
Triple gold double-A Dayton's is the best, ugh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cos where I'm from fool that's what everybody play
UGK-1 written smooth on my plates
Cos real pimp players don't never roll fake
I'm bout to hit Dove Way, get past Troy's
I'm dippin by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass by the Colt I see some women lookin fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the trigger so it bump, ugh
I know you player-hatin busters wanna ride man
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy
(Hook - x2)

It's pimpin pimpin, I'm hittin switches, checkin out my strap

Makin sure these snitches, ain't stoppin riches, 5-Oh on my back
I'm chillin, hidin and winnin, pockets feelin fat
(Bun B)
And I come round your corner shinin, leanin, ever so sunnin
Gangstas put down their gun and
women and children come outside and start runnin
They catch a glimpse of the P-A pimp whoopin whips
Never goin out out like simps, walkin your block with gangsta limp
(Pimp C)
Some fool roll Lincoln, some fools roll Jag
but the crew from Texas roll them Lacs, white gloss and rags
With the candy paint and wheel and grill, and wooden dash
'94 I gotta keep it trill, down for my cash
(Bun B)
I gots my stash so I switches, keep on burnin
and these tyres keep on turnin
I be rollin through your scene, flashin green, freaks be yearnin
to be down, the Under Ground Kingz drinkin Crown with the Coke
Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby
(Hook - x2)
(Bun B)
It's the tough boy, boulevard niggas, rollin around tan up
All four corners on your block fool, nuttin but that bunny hop

Interior crush and fool I'm through clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
in your soul so letta player take control
And do what the hell ya been waitin
to see and that's me rollin on three Dayton's
Wit one of them thangs in the air, it's hangin up there
Shinin steel fat man, but I don't care if everybody sit back and stare
Everywhere we go they linin up as if we're startin up a parade
And everybody thinkin they get paid
But I don't really give a damn, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
on a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right

<SONGSTART>Dear Lord, I know You don't condone
The things I be doin' out here in these streets
And I hope that, I pray that You can overlook
The wrong that I had done in my life
I don't know no other way to survive out here
I got a whole bunch of people dependin' on me
Just walk with me, walk with me
Busslin' and gamblin', hit licks scramblin'
Bricks, I'm out here handlin', I'm pimpin' and I'm payin' the rent
Didn't choose this dirty game, this dirty game, it chose me
Every city love cocaine, they'll get it from him
If they don't get it from me
So I get cross-country with that thang
Makin' that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin' that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
'Cause I put up sum from every sale so all my children can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell
But just put me in woodgrain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that sweet down 'cause that bullshit don't apply to me
'Cause out here on the real streets a dreamer always stay sleep
'Cause out here the strong survive
And now they didn't die from thankin' weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it hard, still tryna get right with God
Still read my Bible lone 'cause Reverend do wrong, still livin' fraud
Tonight if I get down on my knees
And ask the Lord to forgive me, please
You thank He gon' hear me?
'Cause tomorrow I'm still gon' be slangin' ki's
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
See, I was born in the ghetto, manye, I was raised in the hood
And unless you lived it yourself, it just can't be understood
People think hustlin' is cool or hustlin' is live
They don't understand hustlers only hustlin' to survive
They wished they lived in the 'burbs, wished they didn't have to hang
Out on corners in low-income house in projects and slang
They wish their daddy was home, mama wasn't on drugs
And they didn't have to grow up to be dealers and thugs
Po' children got aspirations and dreams just like the wealthy
But it's hard when that environment you live in ain't healthy
You ain't givin' no hope, nobody showin' you pride
And you live with all this anger and frustration inside
Dog, don't let nobody tell you what you can or you can't do
Just 'cause they funky ass couldn't do it, they ain't you
You can be who you wanna be, live life how you feel
Just put your faith in the Lord, now that's keepin' it trill fo' real
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's
For all the niggaz in the game that's been slangin' cheese
For all them boys on them swangers and their fifth wheel
I'm out here riskin' my life, niggaz shife but I stay trill
I pray so much, I wonder if the Lord love me
I think He do but I'm so caught up in my thug deep
The feds bug me, followin' me around for three
Niggaz couldn't catch me so they hit me with conspiracy
You know that that's the other level of the game
Ain't got shit on me but some niggaz said my name
So here they come, they thang tight
They playin' shife, no Bun, givin' me life
I ain't goin' back, I'm a make 'em kill me
I'ma bust back, fuck the pen, you feel me?
Wish I can hug my momma and kiss my baby girl
I know it's a better place than livin' in this dirty world
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Some people win and some people lose
Some always cryin' the blues, yeah
Some people win, some people lose
Some always bein' misused
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
'Cause I need You, Lord, right now
I need You, right now
Need Ya, I need Ya, I need Ya
I need Ya 'cause I'm goin' and livin' too fast, yeah
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast

Accumulating them paper stacks
Im makin money this where its at
Whatever it takes crack or jack
In love with my money and thats a fact
And we STILL RIDIN' DIRTY
Right now we got the 5th wheel reclinin
Trunk popped up screens fallin from the sky
Candy paint sprayed by eddie and im ridin on that glassy chrome
all courtesy of my hustle game
Real hustlin's in my blood line
I dont complain or whine
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make
a dime I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind but now i see that road to riches
Its a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs
I peep game from the best and since then i been playin chess
I put in work with no rest
To get that paper thats my quest
Im on the slow grind towards success
One of the best 'cause i keep it fresh

And im STILL RIDIN' DIRTY

Fuck with me, the rap game'll need protective custody

Gave the game "True Religion" before you found it in denim
Feel the, "Wrath of Kane, " and you could not escape
The hip-hop version of "The Ring" and you just watched the tape (Next up!)
And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We Trill workin the wheel, understand nigga? (UNDERSTAND?)

Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band (rock band!)

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

<SONGSTART>Use me up, I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin' my mind
I'm trippin' and I know it 'cause I'm all nerved up
'Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin' my car
And everyday it get better, I can't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin' she ain't nothin' but a scrub
But she make me feel high like I'm hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I can't help myself, I know that I'm trippin'
But she got it goin' on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my credit card
You know she get it 'cause ya know that
(Chill, C)
I know, G, I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin' pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin' aw'll limp
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and still ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin' good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin' out them duckets and them, croka sacks
And everybody wonderin' why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, ask me why I wanna dis her
I told her 'cause her lovin' ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin' out and Byrd say I'm trippin' too
But this time I just can't listen to my whole crew
'Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But ninety two came around and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
To sum it all up, I'm breakin' all my rules
'Cause she got me droppin' off her little brother to school
I be gettin' bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on sex
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food
UGK sayin' peace out, and plenty of luck
And she could keep usin' Pimp C, uh, just a use me up
Ah, hah, well oh, baby, baby, baby

Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch, holla at yo' bitch, now yo' bitch on my team
Got her buyin' us sticky green, lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch, you lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boyz, that's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today
Pro smoke, pro choke, anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take it, trick, I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya
Rollin' Seville

Grippin' my steal, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
They tellin' me, "Bun, don't go there", but man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas but scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout or smokin' that joint 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain, and leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em from P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em, wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em to hell, to heaven
I just spent 60 G's on a brand new Eldo-reeze
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac, north star fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke when my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch 'cuz I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant, '84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed down Screw tapes that knock, blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks, try 20 ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas

Bitch, how you feel? Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel
Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play, it don't change, ain't a thang to say
It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go
Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers, body rockers
Late night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerrilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us
Touched like Midas, these bitch ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch ass niggas ain't got no cheese?
Blowin' big kill
(Blowin' big kill)
Million dollar deals
(Million dollar deals)
Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Uh, puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J
Smoke somethin', bitch

<SONGSTART>Well it's big Bun Beeda I built the track

It ain't nowhere fans a bunch with these sluts
Just shake your butts and bring back that stack (stack)
The mack is back and he's sittin on chrome
with a piece of chain or Herringbone or nugget (nugget)
That don't mean him a real live hoe
You ain't ready to roll then go on then, fuck it
Out them ducats, hoes better recognize
Niggaz better recollect, Bun finna regulate
I hit yo' town (what) find me a hoe stroll
Leave that bitch dry and head to another state (hold up)
Me and my brother can't wait when it come to the red
Cause we about that cash, cash
So if we can't convince ya we'll take your sister
Hit the highway and mash
You got, bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got, bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got, bitches that can and you got bitches that cain't
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch
Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care
I like the girl with the pussy hair
My partner Mike Mo like the pussy bare
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swang Big Dick, swang Sweet Jones
Go and get the myth out the cobra head
Girl got down you niggaz scared
I got a young yellow bitch, I'ma sing it loud
With a four-inch corner of jet-mink hair
Between her legs is where it great
And get the money out the nigga when she go on a date
I stay caked up, rocked up
Magnum rubbers stay socked up
I ain't tryin to get the wet dick
Hold my good but she ain't that slick
I know you want this high-dollar cum
Bitch know I got money, wanna get her some
Bitch you must, done lost your mind
The trick's niggaz over there, you better get on the grind
Bitches not flexin ain't much good
I should and I would keep clear if I could
But when I do I just CAWN'T get away
Cause I gotta fuck all day every day
That leaves me run loco for real
All these chickenheads lie about deal
Ain't gotta do it up to make me chill
Find a good spot on the floor and kneel!
Know that my heart's in between my fires
Though I can't take when they look in my eyes
Lookin for love that's no surprise
Comin up off, that's family ties
Then I hit it from the back, all the way
Slap that back and just lock cross say
Not freeze out without no delay
Girls in the chat, I ain't got shit to say

Polo horses on my bed-fuck Hilfiga

And bangin' Makaveli 7, crankin' my 'Pac up

And bend they pussy over, for my nigga, and touch they toes
She do that shit for daddy, but them tricks gotta pay
Just like E 40 Pimpin' in a major way
It's all for the money, she tryin' ta stay paid
Steady breakin' niggas on them shiny ass thangs
It's all for the money, she tryin' ta stay paid
Steady breakin' niggas on them shiny ass thangs
It's all for the money, she tryin' ta stay paid

You better get some blades if you still ridin' this ho
Boys puttin' Swangers on Benzes, it gotta stop
If you fittin' ta ride foreign, then, nigga, you gotta chop
And Southern niggas still got the nerve to ride D's
I ain't hatin' on Daytons, but it's 2000, nigga please
It's all about the candy paint, it's all about the Vogues
It's all about the slab, baby, it's all about the hoes
Got some cars and some pros some real and some fraud
Hated on by a nigga, hated on by a broad
So long as J's sell, and them boppin' hoes slut

Quit loven her, leave college, no, quit stopping
Comin down the walls, used to
Be afraid to fall, cause Life is

Some mean shit, I just don't talk cold
I mean shit Comin down like Denzel in the Hurricane
Feel like they're starting fires
And igniting flames, anything
To take down No Came down
Taken for a conviction of triple
Murder, Rubin Carter's life was murdered,
Just like a black man criticized for controversy
Sometimes I start my own, most lies do hurt me
Coming down like a homicide victim,
Just cause I look and sound different
Comin down like James Bond, I'm on another
Mission 005.7 like the rate of homicide victims
Violent crimes are hard to retire, they never Will
I am fucking legend even if I am killed
I'm still that potion, to put haters
In to the motion, Say I'm the reason
For most to believe in, Let's say I'm everything

Comin up, all I wanted to
Be in high school was a jock
A homecoming king, a volley-
Ball player, a boxer, a rockstar, a Rodney King
But no rapper has me beat
An actor, a rocker, a baseball
Player, a professional wrestler
Similar to Brock Lesnar
Even a ladies man, a bodybuilder
Once again a boxer, a skilled dribbler
A debater, snowboarder
A triathlete, a break dancer
Now I hate dancing, a wake boarder
Even a cheerleader, more like
A peer mediator, Who am I
Where's my first breath
Took profound leaps in every step,
I was even into football, ob course
Basketball, bring it soccer, even tennis
Can't stop winning, it's addictive
Life is a game board until you finish it
Even a lifeguard, but I still can't swim

What's the difference between me and you
Comin down with the major talk
What am I going to do after college
Before I graduate, bring it Morgan

Bobby Brown
Last name a color and a noun
I have to cool it now

Start a riot, if you lying

<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F**k it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C:)
Sweet jones
My bitch a choosey lover, never f**k without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like the f**k for 40 dollars in the club
f**king up the game, bitch you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Bun B:)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B U N B
Cause what's a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoes?
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get jones
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi:)
Eni mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-saw pole
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b**** is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, walk it off from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
I, I choose you baby
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>PA, TA and I keep yelling it but y'all don't hear me though
On the cool, I'm trying to tell them it be the place
That I be laying low, lamping in my hometown
Niggaz ain't trippin', so I gets to keep my chrome down
And I be dippin' around the spots that niggaz pass
Swisha's, serving to the fiends, calling me
Mr. Big Buns, snatching checks from your momma
Making dollars, hoes holla, hustling bring ya drama
Uh but I don't sweat it fool, I come from where the best ride
Ain't no punks where I'm from on that West side
PA nigga, outta town with big nuts
Where outta town motherfuckers lose they life on the cut
But we ain't trippin', pass that dipplin'
And it's gonna be all right, soon as I get fried tonight
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
Well, I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm smoking big fat dank
I don't fuck around no mo with that goddamn drank
But every time I get down with my nigga Big Mike
We go and get a bottle of that Dom all night
I got that green monster baby, can you buy that?
Plus I got Swisha suit for days, you wanna try that?
I roll them, most of them big and fat they look like ball bats
I live in P A T, the East side, niggas sayin' jack
These laws be trippin' 'cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it in cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living a Mac
And I ain't trippin', flippin' then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
'Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes

Got boppers that's steady jockin, goofy niggaz in my ear
Bitch I'ma self-made trillionaire, get your soft ass outta here
Weak niggaz wanna plead their case (case), just to raise up out my face (face)
I ain't got that time to waste, punch your mouth and knock out the taste
You MySpacin and Facebookin, playin games with them toys
I'm in the streets where gangstas meet, while you're online with them boys
So step your game up, build your name up, quit your talkin and quit your doin
All that planning and contemplating. when the f**k you gon' start pursuing?
Cars ain't driving themselves, mansions ain't building themselves
They waiting for Annie Mae and they need to stop feelin themselves
They wealth ain't comin until they earn it
But that somethin they won't know 'til they learn it, while burnin...
(Pimp C)
I'ma tell you pussy niggaz once again (once again)

<SONGSTART>Uhhhhhhhh ~!
If you know like I know you would get down on the flo'
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisha full of 'dro
We can get down for my dime and we can f**k, on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha f**kin with me fo'?
Every lady ain't a hoe and every hoe ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't f**k around with no punks
Ride with me she holdin a pistol while I'm whippin and poppin the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems 'long as she hear what the f**k I said
Pimpin ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here livin by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm lookin at you you choosin me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm superstar, we headed to the top
(Chorus: sung)
I'm stayin true, I'm out here whippin my Mercedes
F**kin with the midnight ladies - the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm bangin Screwwww, my young girl lookin fine
We stayin out here on the grind - and keepin money on our mi-ii-iind
(Bun B:)
Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, gotta feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster-ass persona so hard it can dent, steel
In the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leakin fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust

Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leakin out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you gotta go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Gotta pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Gotta play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's yo' turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a f**k how you feel
(Chorus)
(Pimp C:)
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the SOOOOOOOOOUTH
This scary hoe don't wanna know what it's ABOOOOOOOOUT
Cause I stay country true down to the co', dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws, feel it tighten up don't stop don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars, f**k the D.A. f**k the law
I f**k the snow but I love a pro like flatbackers I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer, drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker, bitch around me man I'ma mack her
(Bun B:)
From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of 'dro and Impala bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki', and ten kilos grams in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's one point five mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is tickin, time is pressin
No second guessin, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK
(Chorus)
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S H O R T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be living naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell
I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fucking maker
'Cause I ain't taking, no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts
Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch
This dope ain't yo dope and these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafucking guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafucking road
And don't even try to come back nigga, yo
'Cause me Dre and C got fingers on a fat trigger
We making too much money moving weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper booming cold blow yo ass up
And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailing on yo bitch ass
But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas
Niggaz on the track dropping shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cooking up some llello for the local drug king
The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slanging some more white dust
Real, oh, so trill, the life's no glamor
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fucking up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home
And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales
Stupid muthafuckas smoking dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fighting Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops finding my stash, yo what could the worst be
Through so going undercover then turning dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Calling my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas
I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't 'bout to sell no fucking dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope but you still ain't selling shit
Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon' let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafucking cuts
So step in like I said before, we'll take them muthafucking nuts
Ask the last nigga brought his fucking ass down
Trying to sell that fucking dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'm a go to Port Arthur and run them fucking niggaz
Brought his fucking gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac
Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope
Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
'Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafucking killas
So have your shit attached, before you come check us
Pimp C, bitch, P.A. home, Short Texas

Roll like a stone, like my name Mick Jagger
Say it befo', had to tell you hoes again
Run a drum machine, like my name Roger Men

I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
(Then after I made the record, muh'fuckers said they would never give us no respect)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... (But now they tryna rap like us)
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah... (Tryna be like us, tryna smell like us)
(Knahmtalkinbout?)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money... (Check this out)
[Pimp C:]
Man I refuse to let the bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up, but they cain't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a hoe open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a hoe for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
(right... right...)
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (hmm...)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (hmm...)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho...
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money...
[Pimp C:]
To all the babies havin babies on ya' own
I know you feelin fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, "Ya fucked up your life"
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy with lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggaz tellin you, "Ya crazy"
"What you thankin? You too young to have a family"
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggaz ain't gon ride witchu
But get down with that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin
It's time to change sumthin...
[Chorus]
[Pimp C:]
If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, "It ain't enough room in the NBA"
You tell them haters, "Save that bullshit for another day"
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, "You ain't gon make it", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase to hog it up, the lawyer end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be shame and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right...
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
... (Uh!)

They call me Mick Jagger 'cause I 'Roll a lot of stones'
It's a whole lot of clones but only one Sweet Jones
Turnin' whores to carnivores, they just can't leave my meat alone
It's been a long time since I busted on a glock
But every corner that I hit, I left it screwed up and chopped
Marooned up and dropped, like my Biarritz on top
Let the motherfucker bleed until it drip and let it drop
I'm still that young boy that had a pocket full of stones
But now I'm sick and simply rich, grippin' wood and flippin' chrome

Lay down the competition, take their cash crops and get my push on
Moved up to Bentley with more chrome from a Lexus key
All because we cornered the market on that Texas tee
And we don't bar no plexes, we way bigger than other men though
The diamond deuces on tinted windows, we in the wind yo
We 'Chevro way' the wind blow, that's the corner we been Joe
Don't know where you been bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though
When it's ten fo', good, but in my Styrofoam good and muddy
We block bleeders, leavin' your neighborhoods good and bloody
We grippin' that woodler, bud it, sit back and scope it
Pay attention to Prince and pushin' everything about to pump it

A Phantom Rolls Royce, 24's with the bump
I ain't trippin' about the seat, I got them woofers in my trunk
Cut in my swisher, codeine on my whiskers
Fuckin' with that Smoke D, Bundy and that Vicious
UGK Records, it's an institution
Know a lot of niggaz livin' off of prostitution
Pimpin' ain't dead, it just moved to the web
Bitch ain't gotta hit the track, ain't gotta give no tricks no head
Ain't got to give no tricks, no pussy, just cameras and screams
Easiest money you can get, it's the American Dream bitch
Man I'm a middle finger figure, a million dollar mission
Poppin' like Orville Redenbacher, with a whippin' in the kitchen
Yayo like Dontrelle Willis, we the trillest on the mound
I'm holdin' that whole South down, I know you feel us
We the realest walkin' the planet
Can't stand it, pass away, wanna fight us
Start to swingin', wanna kill us, blast away, wanna stab us
Get to stickin but make sure you cut us deep
'Cause I betcha we comin' back a couple hundred brothers deep
Pimp and Bun, we run the streets, which streets? Man, pick your hood
Don't matter, we represented, cross us? We gon' get you good

Dress above they knees, jellies and G-strings up the ass
Man I never let 'em pass
So, tell me where can I find 'em
With they nigga or in that candy Cadillac right behind him
Bitches tellin' me see yo' dick grand
All she wanna do is ride Su-bur-ban
Put her ass on the leather and rub the wood
See we got boppers in Texas oh, man that pussy look good
So, I let them hoes ride and I show them a grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
When she told me I looked good I didn't feel no pride

Niggaz talkin' 'bout, how they passin' these hoes 'round
But y'all trickin', them hoes told me

You brought the bitch a drink and all her homegirls a beer
Your homeboys lookin for ya, but yo' ass gone
You left your niggaz at the club and took all them hoes home
And didn't even fuck, man what the fuck
If you didn't want to fuck then get the fuck up out the truck
You know what I mean? I ain't showin out Vogues
Just so these hoes can be seen, c'mon you wanna fuck or cut?
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
When you look at my chrome and you lick your lips
It's just like I'm rubbin' my dick between your hips
And when you smile and shake your ass, my grill smile right back
Bitch I'm the real, that's why I ride Cadillac
And I'ma fuck you and fuck all yo' friends
Soon as Pimp C come through in that 600 Benz
With burgundy paint, butter and LG rims
Color TV, VCR playin X-rated films
Of myself, runnin up in beauty queens
But let me tell y'all niggaz the difference between y'all and me
You see, man I can tell all that bitch wanted to do
Is just ride for free and smoke for free
But bitch not me, you better ask them hoes if my name Pimp C
Unless your pussy makin ten thousand dollars a week

the bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
i bet you never seen a big truck like that
i bet you never got a dick sucked like that
the bitch didn't know that i was tapin' the whole scene
now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen

chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
i got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
tryin' to close me down, but i got ghetto love
i'm pimp c bitch, i'm comin' down richer than rich

Verse 2 (bun-b):
We flippin' worldwide, p.a.t. international jetsetters

but don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
breakin' off the jealous with pitch black barettas

mafioso puttin' bombs under my load
never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
now i'm comin' down shinin'

Bloats on my grill with my hand on my steel (steel)
Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing
I'ma gon' and pop the trunk, surely but slowly
Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your Colby Jet system (no)
Your slab ain't holdin, ain't no use to you frontin
And I'm fin' to shut the game down when I push the button
And the... [echoes]
[Chorus]
[Cory Mo:]
Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang
Cory Mo about to do the damn thaaaaang
In the butter guts with the diamond in the back
King Kongs in the trunk, hit the switch and watch it crack
I'ma let my paper stack and quote nothin but facts
So don't "ax" me nothin partner 'less you droppin some cash (cash)
Now she hoppin it fast (fast) that's just how I like it (like it)
Turn around and show me somethin girl I'm gettin excited (oooh)
Ain't nobody trippin cause the money already made
I done said it befo', so I'ma say it again
And let my top drop dowwwwwn
[Chorus]
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>It all started with a Pimp C, bitch
So what the fuck is up?
Told 'em somethin' good
Ease up my muthafuckin' cut
'Cause if you don't really wanna fuck wit a trill nigga
From the trill villa wit a steel trigga land of the real killers
Pop pop muthafucka there you go
I'ma bust 'em on yo ass if you don't ease up off me ho
'Cause trill niggas don't carry no sugar in they nutsac
Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack
So you gon' give me my money but you don't hear me though
But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes
P.A. nigga, trill ass nigga
How you figga you can buck me down nigga?
Mr. big an, Mr. big time, give me what's mine
Instead of buying cars for a bitch named sunshine
Give me what's mine, give me what's mine
Before it come down to triggas
Shit, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Bitch, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Uh, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
But you can't hear me
It's the return of the trill ass niggas bitch
Yea muthfuckas, I figured you run
I figured you run, when I pull triggas to guns
That triggas to guns P.A. fool a nigga named Bun
A nigga named Bun, no more sun, no more shine
Say hello to the nine milly millameter
(Buck, buck, buck)
Money tight glock, bustin' them shots
When I break yo ass off somethin' hot
Niggas steady catchin' lead to the head
I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin' bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin', niggas start passin' away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise, I'm gettin' Chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now it's the return of the trill ass niggas

Boy, used to come up from the rags to the riches
Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches
But now it's like the game is full of nothin' but some snitches
And wanna be gangsters that's scared to put 'em in ditches
Fed's takin' pictures so the cameras go click
And video rollin' while I'm holdin' my dick
They follow me around like they doin' they job
But while you watchin' me how many people gettin' robbed
Lets keep it trill 'cause we already know

Before we go any further, take your lighter, light it up for me

Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know

Hope your drink don't spill whippin' big wheels
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

Put your hands in the air raise 'em up for Pimp C

She got class and panache with precision
Picture perfect in my vision and I done made a decision
That I'm tired of wishin, get down with the Bun and Pimp and
You could roll with the playas on the million dollar mission, c'mon
Uhh, hey mama, I'm a tell you what the deal is
I like your style, I like how you handle your business
You ain't out here trippin chasin boys in showbiz
You're confident, you out here puttin it down for yo' kids

He ain't teachin you nothin, you need to learn me
Check out my mind, I'm 24 on the grind
I got the key to the streets, I got a open line
And I don't get caught up in "he say, she say"
And I don't chase the cat, I keep the P play

Still I fits, out, cause she thick, stout
With the feminine fat, in all the right places
She look me in my eyes and she make all the right faces
Cause she's a real catch, we make a tough pair
A true dynamic duo and we up there
We sittin tall at the top
And if she ride or die for me playa I'm a give her all that I got
I break her off and not, let her hold the keys
I don't take her out of town, man I take her oas
It ain't trickin if you spend it on your lady
Bring the bacon home to baby and everything'll be gravy
Just let me know if that's soundin like a plan
Cause all you really need to change your life is the man
And you appealin to the King of the Trill and

[Bun B]
A bad day for the niggaz in my click
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It's seems the drug situation is so tow up
And poes down the fuckin T-X had to show up
I got shit on the scene so 99 can't hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret and there's no rest
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
In Dynasties.I-ROCs... and Caravans and muthafuckas are swolen
Like paper stacks and a rubberband
Goin all out of tact on the local bird slaggin brothaman
And be servin as slow as fuck
Cause my niggaz are nervous
and if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggaz is happy with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town
Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my tags off my buick and yall know I didn't love that
Rollin on some white balls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, YOU GOTS TO DO YOUR OWN NAILS!
I told my niggaz to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town
God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back up!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my click
Got the birds, and reopen my lab back up
And told my boys, "If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye,
Don't give him a chance to identify!"
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at random, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Close to the dopeman - God damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
CAUSE IN MY YARD IS A BIG ASS - I GOT YALE SIGN!
It's time for TONY MONTANA stacks
I got niggaz on the corner holdin big ass bags and cans of crack
The land of Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fools run in with your glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last love
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight lights
when the feds in town
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

Comin' down on the slab, boy
Ridin' dirty, for real tho, ridin' dirty
Have you ever been rollin' in a clean ass 'Lac
Blowin' big out the window, everybody got a sack
Got my heat right between my seat, got a box of them thangs
In case these fools start playin' with me
You'd be surprised how them boppers wink, girl, I can't stop
Give my headlights a blink and roll them up out the top
And keep movin' and keep rollin'
Fools that don't be holdin' I'm comin' through and foldin'
And I can't stand snitches, wanna kill all of y'all
Even though some bustas fall I'm still rollin' like a ball
And having things my way, hittin' that highway
Sellin' that big yay, a plush-ass place to stay
Police, they wanna run in
Talkin' on cell phones got a lotta kids done in
I wanna live like Arnold, Willis and Mr. Drummond
And keep my paper sturdy, big birds and tight herbs
Fool, I'm ridin' dirty
Big birds and tight herbs, fool I'm ridin' dirty
Ridin' dirty, fool, ridin' dirty
Tell me can you feel it? Man, nothin' can save ya
I believe it's that season for gettin' yo papers
Or haven't you heard about them birds? We call it that cheese
In Texas we get it with ease, hit I-10 if you please
But these polices, they think they sharp as creases
For no reasons, man, they straight up strippin' cars to pieces
Out of suspicion or if they thinkin' you on a mission
Ain't no wishin' or prayin', they sayin' assume the position
Hands behind ya head, down on ya knees
You get the case and they get yo weight and yo G's
Come on, I use to ride the Port Arthur city streets
With a chick with pretty feets and a box of Philly Sweets
They tried to finish me but couldn't get it done
So somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty
Man, somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty

Tell 'em like this, ya better get up out my camp dude
Befo' I have to pull my gat and get, real rude
I don't figure that it's worth gettin hurt
Just 'cause ya gal wanna give me that skirt
Bet it feels funny when ya doin 69
Knowin that ya sippin on all my jimmy wine
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bad
Knowin that ya swallowed all the skeeter that I had?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda shot you up instead I told ya somethin good
[Chorus: sampled from Chaka Khan & Rufus' "Something Good"]
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah... yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
[Bun B:]
Aiyyo, what's up with that bulge in ya khakis?
You wanna pack a gat, but you STILL ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gangload of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cause by yourself, you're runnin to the flo'
I seen your kind befo', man ya nothin with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin when ya chillin with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin up some daisies
See crazy you wanna be, but punks with no heart, they ain't hard
They just waitin for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep your weak self locked in ya hood
Cause without your boys I'm a have to tell ya somethin good
[Chorus]
(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)
[Pimp C:]
Brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check ya girl and what she did in the past
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her REAL fast
But I don't trust the dugout, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check ya blood and let somebody check your teeth
But if you don't step, I'm a drop on ya fast
And pump off bullets like government cash
I didn't do ya girl but your sister was alright
Took her to my homeboy's Caddy last night [girl moaning in the background]
She waxed my jimmy, and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit if from the back, and the girl just THREW ME
Told me, "Pump it harder, " and she scratched me on my BOOTY
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty lil' girl
[Chorus 1/2]
[Bun B:]
Let's talk about these half-n-half punks
By day they sorry bastards, at night they talkin bout, poppin trunks
Butter .25 cain't keep you alive
From a sawed-off, fool so I hope you survive
See bluffin might save ya tail one day
But who's ta say, it won't catch ya next week, on the runway?
You might shoot a few shots in the wind
But the same time tomorrow, you'll be runnin again
Now can you keep it up, every damn night?
You steady runnin to the argument but runnin from the fight
What's the deal man? Why don't you take your Raiders cap off?
Cause one of these days, you gonna getcha head slapped off
You cain't keep a crew cause they gettin sick of seein you bail
Like a punk'll hit the backstreet trail
And the women don't like you cause ya act like them
And that's why your little jimmy never went fo' a swim
Ya talk about slangin, makin G's
But I saw a fiend chase ya from, BJ's up to Mickey D's
Now everyday punks get took
Either for they dough, they'll ride 'em for the powder that they cook
You bookin from the scene cause ya couldn't hold ya own
A 40 ounce bottle slams, ya dead to your dome
Now you want revenge, so ya get your automatic
Find a group of hard-heads, and startin kickin static
Ya pulled ya little chrome but these fools got gats
Try to run and caught two buckshots in ya back
Now you nothin but a memory that's gone in a slayin
So when I tell you somethin good, punk I don't be playin

Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what y'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'.
This is the conclusion: pimpin' ain't no illusion.
[Chorus: x2]
Bun B:
If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her,
'Cause a beggar ain't a muthafuckin' chooser.
Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean.
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a wif a this...
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior... and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny... sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again... that's why...
[Chorus: x2]
Too $hort:
You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money... it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game.
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it.
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin'...beeyatch.
[Chorus: x3]
...pimpin' ain't no illusion
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part."
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it"
"Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets"
"Had to tie her to a rocket"
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up"
"Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up"
"(Shit)"

They diamonds ain't shinin' and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm grippin' on the grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm workin' wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville, your step daddy can get killed
If he keeps talkin' shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you tryin' to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the South
For them niggas and them girls with them golds in they mouth
The boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill, bitch you ain't what this about, about
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit

So I'm forever bring the blues to the issue
Pick and choose if I miss ya, stick and move when I diss ya
Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, it was made for me to gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my

Too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars, baby ballin'
Bullshitter, frontin' like rottweiliers, no bark, no bite
But showin' thangs, talkin' loud like they knowin' thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane, your ass mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight, it ain't no passin' tonight

With a rusty ass niner lookin' for trouble

<SONGSTART>Hold up
It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital
Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that
There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?"
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'

And I'm bringing this paper faster than
These other lil bastards can
So I'm digging in my mind for the bitches I broke
And keep a player paid in full cause pimping ain't no joke
You want to pop that pussy that's a slim ass chance
Put the paper in the panties when you get that dance
This C.O.D. nigga, so you can keep your nuh plastic cards
No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers
But why slap us when you think a nigga down on his luck
You try and flag us when you see us coming down in a buck
Now what the fuck part of the game taught y'all that bitch play
See we makes a bitch pay

And the game that we go don't stop (don't stop)

And you know that we always blowing herb (blowing herb)
And in the club man you know we stay strapped (stay strapped)
And bitch you know that it ain't about this rap (ain't about this rap)
To many niggaz out here buying hoes a meal
Nigga that ain't the way a bitch supposed to feel

Fuck me right and suck me tight
And you just might hit the blunt hoe
I don't stunt and blow smoke up your ass baby
But don't be acting all saditty with class baby
You with a nigga such as my self it'll cost you
So pay before a nigga fuck around and be the tosser
Sweet Jones, gripping grain
With all that shit you talk ain't got no bezatine chain
And most of y'all niggaz ain't nothing but tricks
But we sipping lean and breaking bricks
Popping pills, work the wood wheel
Fuck where you're from and fuck how you feel
If you want to go to war I'll take you to war

I got them bitches popping pussy getting buck (getting buck)
And you know that we couldn't give a fuck (give a fuck)
I got them bitches on the corner selling cock (selling cock)

I'm always trying to put in work
Niggaz wanna do my dirt
Balling down on Beale Street
Sipping on a pint of syrup
Chopping up the chronic weed
Picking all the fucking seeds
Trying to slow my roll
In my trunk I got them fucking keys
Always riding Chevy things
Shining on them twanky things
Kids I'm a role model
Police I'm a dope man
Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead
Never has it left my mouth
Optimos a fifth of crown
Red eyes with a frown
Niggaz with them gold teeth
Fast talking on the town
Some of us are under cover

Knot in my right pocket
Left pocket got them rubbers
Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash
I'mma go pimp a bitch

Always got to watch your friends
Backstabbers cause a snitch

Pussy nigga, I pack that nine everytime and I ain't trying dying
I just wanna celebrate
Cause trill niggaz don't die
Pussy nigga, thinking you gon kill me
I got some'ing for your ass, nigga you gon feel me
I'ma blow you out the water, with the 2-23
Putting dick up in your daughter, rap is over I serve some cheese
Nigga talking bout, robbing Chad
Run up on me with that first, will leave you stinking in the grass
If your calico to mask, if you Baptist go to church
See a hoe up in a nigga, gon pull up a skirt
That'll be, some incredible shit
Niggaz scheming on my bezel, on some devilish shit
I been to hell and back, on another level you bitch
Go on try it I'm going live, they gon need a shovel for you bitch
I been stabbed I been shot, went from no fans to being hot
But somehow always fall short, for trying to keep fiddles in my pot
In a dog eat dog world, y'all fellas be chasing girls
When I place myself in history, too hot for a ladder to catch me
But I can't help but to notice, I'm one of the coldest
And I know y'all haters love when I'm locked up, but I won't lose focus
Yeah I wrote this counting down, how many days I got
So lately my gun ain't been hid, it's been displayed a lot
My attitude is fucked up, I don't give a fuck cause I just don't give one
Thinking bout living a life where everything you do right is wrong, mo'fucker I live one
I know niggaz wanna kill me, but I'm still riding pride
Cause the Lord riding with me, and that's the main reason why
Some niggaz win, and some niggaz lose
Some niggaz getting bruised, some always crying to blues
Some niggaz already lost, and ain't gon lose no mo'
Big shoes hoe choose, ain't paying dues no mo'
Everything y'all trying to do, I built a school hoe
Now it's fly to talk country, I made the rules hoe
I was sagging in my khaki's, 'fore Dickies cool
Gangsta Nike's on my feet, our music banging in the streets
The young B.G.'s, really love to thump
Fuck radio and BET, I'm out here bumping in the trunk
For the girls popping pussy, and the boys with the blow
Cadillac'ers and flat-backers, I'm out here repping for it hoe
Can't any man, boy or woman take away my soul
It's a gift given from God, and I'm keeping a tight hold
The world is ugly and cold, trying to make me the same
But I'ma keep it one hundred, when it come to the game
Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up
We keep it click tight, so when niggaz start lurking
In the dark heaters start, anybody start jerking
Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg
A dragging society, don't borrow don't beg
For tomorrow so gon 'head with your pity, I'ma be cool
Kindergardeners was looking up to me, in pre-school
Down with Pimp C fool, and P-A-T the town
Representing it to the fullest, till I'm gone I hold it down
Bun Beater, would never sell you no lie
So if you ask for the truth, I'ma reply to trill niggaz don't die

(cocaine cocaine) UGK, UGK bitch my man Bun B
Pimp C in the house y'all, put your hands together
Big Dick Cheney and Snowy Snow, (cocaine cocaine)
(Pimp C:)
Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggaz, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'ma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose
Cocaine, cocaine
(Bun B:)
They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Columbia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine
(Rick Ross:)
You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
And my yayo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

Here, these rappers ain't good for store
Too weak, must be a birth defect

That means Raplete's infection
If you play against me, synonym of ill
Opposite of well, can't anticipate me
You're in a position to fail
If you're not sick, as far or rhyming
Or studying to go to College
Don't be hiding, call in Mr.

Fast enough and got blasted up with a bullet
I'm snipin', I got you in my scope so what's the use of tryin' to bail?
I'm ready to catch a case but not for yayo, for a murder, mayne

To the sucka muthafuckas that was fakin' it
Makin' it known I gots my chrome in my ride
And I'm fried, PA nigga worldwide from the Westside, fool

Yeah, ya bastards, I'm serious, this is only one of three sixteens
Straight up, I'm serious that was only one of three sixteens

Punk ass niggas, I'm serious, this was two of three sixteens

Some muthafuckas think they can go with me
But most of them niggas just some hoes to me
I got a lotta niggas that's down with me
But too many niggas like to clown with me
They act like they know me but they really don't
They ask me to come kick it but they know I won't
I see they ass in PA, they don't know me
I see they ass in Houston, I'm they homie
But nigga, how it feel to be a ho?
Gettin' yo ass kicked at every muthafuckin' show
Tryin' to be a gangsta but nigga you's a fool
And tryin' to kick it with me, like me and y'all cool

But bitch niggas steal and G niggas mack
And busta ass niggas gettin' bullets in they back

And yo it ain't about the phone call, this about the nut'n
So let me bust a fat load on your bellybutton
See, quiet storm done put a notch on your belt
And when it's over, I don't wanna hear how it felt
I'm just pullin off my rubber, takin a bath
Gettin dressed to reminisce of how I cut ya in half
It's all in the day of an Underground fool
So dial the digits and I'm divin in that ass like a pool
But when I get wet BITCH, I won't be drownin
I clown on hoes to leave their pussyhole frownin
Or if you bitches wanna hear some more of this
Lock your bedroom door trick, pick up your cordless
You can suck a mean dick, lick a good ball
And if I keep on fuckin, you'll keep on callin
And I'll be playin you, when you think you'll be playin me
It's just pussy games with some help from AT&T
So if you need a dick to be real friendly
Dial nine-seven-six, B-U-N-B, bitch!

My Midwest women

Down South women, the West Coast women
All of my women
Now bein' King of the Underground's a title I wear with pride
Like my syrup and swisha can't leave without it when I ride
Even though I'm the king of the city where I reside
I wouldn't and couldn't do it without my woman on my side
Sometimes I got it figured out, sometimes I'm confused
I win 9 times out of 10 but now and then I might lose
But no matter the road I choose and how the drama unfold
A playa always got his better half right on his shoulders
She gon' hold me down to the fullest, rainy or sunny
She seen me ball out of control and dead broke with no money
So when the game got funny, she ain't pack up and roll
She help me get back on my feet now man that's way too cold
If you got a down woman wit'chu keepin' it true
Don't try to hate, appreciate her for the things that she do
This dedicated to the dedicated ladies that stand up
If you keep it real wit your man then put your hand up, c'mon
This for the real women
(The solid ladies and the pros)

I'm 'bout to spoil you, show you my gratitude
I love the all of you, even your attitude
Never gonna give you black-n-blues
That's abuse, I'm not that dude
Take it back to when I held yo' hand
And my name became yo' back tattoo
I love the fact that you don't need me to make you whole
Doin' it fast or takin' it slow, you know when to let me take control
And I apologize for puttin' tears inside them eyes
When I wasn't fair didn't compromise
Put you in fear when I told them lies
How I love to dive inside them thighs I love your cockiness
Ain't gonna ask if you roll in rap you know this right it's obvious
I'm an Underground King with a winner down
Queen I'm fin' to let her know
This ain't about bling, this ain't about cream, I never let her go
We smokin' love, you know what's up
This for the real women, that's you? Throw it up
'Cause your man's so focused
You rub your lips lovin' the bub 'cause I open you up
You got my back whether broke or re-up
In the crush limousine 'cause we rollin' up
This for the real women

Ridin' tryin' to get the dirty do'
Didn't know what my life was gon' have in sto'
'Til my karma came
And you was right there tryin' to have my thangs
When the chips all fell down
You was the only one I had around
Saved my life when I was 'bout to drown
Girl you my queen, come and get your crown
Now I keep you with the nice thangs
VVS ice blings, 10-karat diamond rings
If I ain't tell you with the biz
Girl you my baby 'til the end
And I'ma treat you like a king supposed
Keep you ridin' Rolls slammin' matchin' do's

<SONGSTART>(Andre 3000 with "I choose you babe!" in the back)
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F*** it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that b**** do you dirty
we'll wipe her a** out and send detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C)
Sweet jones
My b**** a choosey lover, never f*** without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for 40 dollars in the club
f***** up the game, b**** you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them b****es too scary
Your b**** chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Bun B)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
Because its greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
Im a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar b****
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C & B U N B
Cause whats a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoe
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose
OOOooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi)
Eeny mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl dont touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the C-Support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers couldn't stop the
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last pump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooooohhhhh Ooooooohhh
I chose you girl
IIIIiiii

Well, well, I know, I know, I know, yeah
Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin' crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper I gotta do it quick
Thinkin' I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin' wit, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live everyday like it's my muthafuckin' last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'ma die
But if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'ma take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say, "It'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
This world we livin' in man it ain't nuthin' but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya in New York niggas gettin' shot fo bombers
Now they got yo life in the former they in like California
Niggas wit dubs are hydroponic, marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pops died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wished it was twice mayn
I remember bein' eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not givin' a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' to the end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen fo damn near ten
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day you here but the next day you gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
I'm up early 'cuz ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets Peanut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin' shife, so shife back
Can't show no weakness wit these bitches life jacked
Mayn it's a trip where I stay especially for me
Them bitches tryin' to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga down in Florida Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I ain't no liar
My man BoBo jus' lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God why he let these killas live
And take my homeboy's son away
Man if you got kids show 'em you love 'em
'Cuz God jus might call 'em home
'Cuz one day you're here, the next day you're gone
I know, you know, well, well, yeah
La ra la ra, I know, yeah, yeah

I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pimpin' down the ave you know I'm lookin' tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that
Who's says he's going through a thang
When ya'll ain't never lied
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
When I hurt and try to hate 'cause she knows the thrill is gone
Say man, I stop smokin' with haters back in ninety four
But niggas thinkin' that a sweeps gone get the through my door
And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye to eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight
And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this away
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away
My dead homey momma's tear shit
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 503
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets just keep on gettin' live with me
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin' that
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains
It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to ESG and all the victims of the game
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I'm pimpin' through the ave. tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown, when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuck 'n' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood

I never wanted to be a G but Niggas depend on me
It ain't fake to hit a 10 so niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushing cocaine niggas holding pistols
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20, 000 tryin' to turn it into a hundred, and ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas came to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch thinking she can ease my mind by suckin' my dick
Bitch make up for a minute cause that ship never last
In 1996 niggas is dyin' from layin' on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Easy-E died
And you be wonderin' why you niggas
Out there smokin'cri
I wish that I could tell y'aIl wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that nigga you know that I would be lyin'
And I been f**kin' pussy since the tender age of nine
It's gettin' to be a full-time job just tryin' to stay alive
And crack a scandalous smirk offended by the weed
Smoke comin' of my shirt
But I still put in work and front for my folks
'cause where I come from nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe
Some say that nigga's sellin' dope
And you know I ain't lyin' that just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the devil poke you
With his fork
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophet, f**kin' hoes
And gettin' paid
I'm looking for that
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life
You only got one life to live that's all they give us to do it
You could bullshit your way through it or stay true
It can be complicated cause niggas
Be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the people
In the lane get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive, take your positions
With pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dust
To see the only stretch rest see how we was left to be
Down these streets that we be on
Motherf**kers sleepin' on them corners that you be on
Probably because society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the f**k made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas sellin' that dank
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of the American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on who gives a damn
When you can't afford a turkey or ham
Livin' off of Ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab, it's far from me
To push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your man
And so instead of being without I'm hustlin' tryin' to
Get through these ungodly days
Thinkin' of ways to get the f**k out of this maze
A man'll commit a crime who the& f**k it crime pays
I'm goin' through a phase you don't go out until you
Out reason a motherf**ker
Gots to pour out this 40 on the curb, disturbed and
Left with no doubt in this mind
But still sometimes he don't know why he walkin' around just hopin'
He can get one more try to make it
It's a bullshit he goin' through but yo he gots,
You can't fake it to get the
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life

But the game been good to meeeee...
UHH, first album went platinum, now you can't go gold
Made ya deal with the devil, but you sold yo' soul
You rent a lotta cars, rent a mansion and them hoes
You say you sold your Phantom, bitch they took yo' Rolls
Get disrespected everywhere you go
Big bodyguards when you come for the shows
They already know you got shit on your name
Nigga, you a pussy, they gon' take yo' chain
Take yo' piece, rings and watch
You play rich, boy you need to stop
I ain't dissin nobody, no particular name
Ya shoe fit nigga, get the fuck up out the game - lil' BITCH!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
I'm a Down South MC, I'm cold on the mic
I say it how I feel and I do it how I like
I write what I see, what I do, and what I know
And keep it one hundred off top from the do'
Now whether at a show, in the booth, or on the street
No matter where I go and no matter who I meet
Everybody tryna tell me how they feel 'bout the South
On the cool, them haters need to shut they fuckin mouth
'Cause we grip grain, nigga we pop trunk
We to' straps and we ready for the funk
Some niggaz two-step, some niggaz dance
Some niggaz just ball wit' a bottle in they hands
Sell a couple ringtones niggaz, that's bread
You hatin on paper get that FUCK up out yo' head
Worryin 'bout my cheese, getcha own stack
It's goin down in the South, you don't like it
Click clack, motherfucker!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
You got caught with that work on 10
Made a deal with the state to turn your foul partner in
But he took 15, befo' you could tell
He ain't witchu no mo' hoe, you got twenty in a cell
I sent you a lawyer, you ain't listened that time
Ain't no appeal, but they dropped it to five?
Who you had to fuck to give back that time?
Textin me from a cell phone - bitch, yo lost YO' FUCKIN MIND?
How dare you tryna get me on conspiracy, Jack?
If the feds hit me, I'ma hit yo' ass BACK!
You fight witcho tounge, I send 'em killa
Transcript writer, I'll kill you nigguuuh!
(Smoke sum'hin, bitch.)
Got caught with the shit, twenty years

Bought me all, of yo' dough.

"Got front and back, and side to side" ---> MC Ren
"Got front and back, and side to side"
"Got front and back, and side to side"
(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush inside ? ? is fresh
Triple gold double-A Dayton's is the best, ugh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cos where I'm from fool that's what everybody play
UGK-1 written smooth on my plates
Cos real pimp players don't never roll fake
I'm bout to hit Dove Way, get past Troy's
I'm dippin by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass by the Colt I see some women lookin fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the trigger so it bump, ugh
I know you player-hatin busters wanna ride man
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy
(Hook - x2)
(Pimp C)
It's pimpin pimpin, I'm hittin switches, checkin out my strap
but I keep on dippin, steady pimpin, kickin, how's about the winter man?
Makin sure these snitches, ain't stoppin riches, 5-Oh on my back
I'm chillin, hidin and winnin, pockets feelin fat
(Bun B)
And I come round your corner shinin, leanin, ever so sunnin
Gangstas put down their gun and
women and children come outside and start runnin
They catch a glimpse of the P-A pimp whoopin whips
Never goin out out like simps, walkin your block with gangsta limp
(Pimp C)
Some fool roll Lincoln, some fools roll Jag
but the crew from Texas roll them Lacs, white gloss and rags
With the candy paint and wheel and grill, and wooden dash
'94 I gotta keep it trill, down for my cash
(Bun B)
I gots my stash so I switches, keep on burnin
and these tyres keep on turnin
I be rollin through your scene, flashin green, freaks be yearnin
to be down, the Under Ground Kingz drinkin Crown with the Coke
Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby
(Hook - x2)
(Bun B)
It's the tough boy, boulevard niggas, rollin around tan up
All four corners on your block fool, nuttin but that bunny hop
happenin, high gassin, daily routine, my load is plush
Interior crush and fool I'm through clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
in your soul so letta player take control
And do what the hell ya been waitin
to see and that's me rollin on three Dayton's
Wit one of them thangs in the air, it's hangin up there
Shinin steel fat man, but I don't care if everybody sit back and stare
Everywhere we go they linin up as if we're startin up a parade
And everybody thinkin they get paid
But I don't really give a damn, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
on a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right
(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
Never let broke gold diggers ride
Never let broke gold diggers ride
"Got front and back, and side to side"

<SONGSTART>Dear Lord, I know You don't condone
The things I be doin' out here in these streets
And I hope that, I pray that You can overlook
The wrong that I had done in my life
I don't know no other way to survive out here
I got a whole bunch of people dependin' on me
Just walk with me, walk with me
Busslin' and gamblin', hit licks scramblin'
Bricks, I'm out here handlin', I'm pimpin' and I'm payin' the rent
Didn't choose this dirty game, this dirty game, it chose me
Every city love cocaine, they'll get it from him
If they don't get it from me
So I get cross-country with that thang
Makin' that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin' that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
'Cause I put up sum from every sale so all my children can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell
But just put me in woodgrain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that sweet down 'cause that bullshit don't apply to me
'Cause out here on the real streets a dreamer always stay sleep
'Cause out here the strong survive
And now they didn't die from thankin' weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it hard, still tryna get right with God
Still read my Bible lone 'cause Reverend do wrong, still livin' fraud
Tonight if I get down on my knees
And ask the Lord to forgive me, please
You thank He gon' hear me?
'Cause tomorrow I'm still gon' be slangin' ki's
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
See, I was born in the ghetto, manye, I was raised in the hood
And unless you lived it yourself, it just can't be understood
People think hustlin' is cool or hustlin' is live
They don't understand hustlers only hustlin' to survive
They wished they lived in the 'burbs, wished they didn't have to hang
Out on corners in low-income house in projects and slang
They wish their daddy was home, mama wasn't on drugs
And they didn't have to grow up to be dealers and thugs
Po' children got aspirations and dreams just like the wealthy
But it's hard when that environment you live in ain't healthy
You ain't givin' no hope, nobody showin' you pride
And you live with all this anger and frustration inside
Dog, don't let nobody tell you what you can or you can't do
Just 'cause they funky ass couldn't do it, they ain't you
You can be who you wanna be, live life how you feel
Just put your faith in the Lord, now that's keepin' it trill fo' real
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's
For all the niggaz in the game that's been slangin' cheese
For all them boys on them swangers and their fifth wheel
I'm out here riskin' my life, niggaz shife but I stay trill
I pray so much, I wonder if the Lord love me
I think He do but I'm so caught up in my thug deep
The feds bug me, followin' me around for three
Niggaz couldn't catch me so they hit me with conspiracy
You know that that's the other level of the game
Ain't got shit on me but some niggaz said my name
So here they come, they thang tight
They playin' shife, no Bun, givin' me life
I ain't goin' back, I'm a make 'em kill me
I'ma bust back, fuck the pen, you feel me?
Wish I can hug my momma and kiss my baby girl
I know it's a better place than livin' in this dirty world
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Some people win and some people lose
Some always cryin' the blues, yeah
Some people win, some people lose
Some always bein' misused
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
'Cause I need You, Lord, right now
I need You, right now
Need Ya, I need Ya, I need Ya
I need Ya 'cause I'm goin' and livin' too fast, yeah
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Out here livin' too fast, how long can it last?
I can't get up, Lord, can You help me?
Lord, can You help me? Can You help me?
Can You help me, right now, yeah

And im hustlin on the grind 72

Im campaignin for a new Benz
On the rims with bubble lenz
Im stackin' every dollar i see 100s 50s 20s and 10s
Doors open doors close never sweat hoes playas get yo's
Hustle and flow cars clothes thats the playa like that i know
Roll the dank up where the dro?
Pour the drank up where the fo's
Stackin money all on the low and we still ridin dirty
Got a drop top on them rollerskates
Candy jolly rancher paint
Enjoyin the spoils of hard work and grind more tryin to get bank
I dont know what them boys thinkin my motivation is benjamin franklin
Im tryin to maintain this wealth that i been calculatin
Gettin money thats all i know
On my toes never off my note
Woodgrain and hundred spokes i wave the trunk just like a pro
I grind its off to work i go I hustle hard its no stop
And if i flop i switch to hustle
I learned the game then set up shop
Im strivin' to make it to the top
Its all or nothin no turnin back
Im with them boys out on the block
Accumulating them paper stacks
Im makin money this where its at
Whatever it takes crack or jack
In love with my money and thats a fact
And we STILL RIDIN' DIRTY
Right now we got the 5th wheel reclinin
Trunk popped up screens fallin from the sky
Candy paint sprayed by eddie and im ridin on that glassy chrome
all courtesy of my hustle game
Real hustlin's in my blood line
I dont complain or whine
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make
a dime I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind but now i see that road to riches
Its a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs
I peep game from the best and since then i been playin chess
I put in work with no rest
To get that paper thats my quest
Im on the slow grind towards success
One of the best 'cause i keep it fresh
Im one hundred isnt nothin less
And im STILL RIDIN' DIRTY

<SONGSTART>Gawd-DAYUM! I don't know what y'all been thinkin bout
But I think this right here is about to shut dem damn haters down!
I'm from the streets that make niggaz walk slow talk low
With white chalk-o, mi casa be siete uno ocho
Brooklyn motherfucker, handle this - pardon my Spanish and French (Brooklyn baby!)
Okay, I stay clever like Mayweather with lay leather
'til your face sever, one of the greatest ever
Beyond ringing bells, my name's so demanding
Shit! - I got the swagger that'll leave Dakota "Fanning" (That boy still standing!)
I hope you niggaz over standing; I stay sucker-free
The next kaing of in the game, you ain't got enough to be
Your career last a week, that'll be luckily
Fuck with me, the rap game'll need protective custody
(AHH!) I'm the same thug to be, surrounded with women
Gave the game "True Religion" before you found it in denim
Feel the, "Wrath of Kane, " and you could not escape
The hip-hop version of "The Ring" and you just watched the tape (Next up!)
And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We Trill workin the wheel, understand nigga? (UNDERSTAND?)
I smother and split a bitch down to the tendon
High pressure, if you don't break your ass bendin
I'm way past endin in my series of warnin
You flex with me tonight playa you dead by the mornin (Woo!)
Bun Beater the best ever breathin or deceased
From the South to Midwest, Cali to the East
Got to any city nigga and bring my name up (all o'em!)
I bet I eat the best rapper they got in the game up
Call a nigga up, email him or chirp him
Make a meal out his motherfuckin ass and then burp him
(DAYUM!) Don't fuck around I'm not your lil' homey
I'm the king of the underground so act like you know me (Next up!)
Feel me...
Homie, we big steppin, big reppin
We givin kids Smith & Wesson's lessons, you get left with a sketchin
Left with the Midwest, clique Texans (who dat?)
G. and Daddy Kane, the click Texas, (word) pop you to death
I put private planes on swift Jetsons, niggaz know what it is
When you see the ball cap and a slick Thessons (woo!)
(Aight) Til you strip vexing to a movie clip from the Westerns
Shit from the Uzi clip lift up your midsection (Tell em G. Rap)
He will introduce you to the nose on the Glock fam
Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band (rock band!)
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man (AOOOW!)
High roller dose some hoes on the cock plan
Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin cheese til the rubberbands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em "Hot Pants" (Next up!)
I make your girl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt
I'm a young hot street flame (Flame)
They call me Sweet James, or call me Sir Jones
Two hundred dollar cologne
(Uh!) Board Nine, or Issey Miyaki
I got your girl mine, meat strong like saki
I ain't Rocky but I keep her rockin
Fuck around I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket
Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin watchin my top fall in
On my Lambourghini with the quick scream
Fettucini, linguini, shrimp and a bowl of lean!
What you know about gettin cross country
Nigga your piece big but your diamond look monkey

Put a few tips in her mouth, that's that definition
Of them true chicks in the South, let me do my thang

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

<SONGSTART>Use me up, I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin' my mind
I'm trippin' and I know it 'cause I'm all nerved up
'Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin' my car
And everyday it get better, I can't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin' she ain't nothin' but a scrub
But she make me feel high like I'm hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I can't help myself, I know that I'm trippin'
But she got it goin' on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my credit card
You know she get it 'cause ya know that
(Chill, C)
I know, G, I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin' pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin' aw'll limp
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and still ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin' good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin' out them duckets and them, croka sacks
And everybody wonderin' why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, ask me why I wanna dis her
I told her 'cause her lovin' ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin' out and Byrd say I'm trippin' too
But this time I just can't listen to my whole crew
'Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But ninety two came around and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
To sum it all up, I'm breakin' all my rules
'Cause she got me droppin' off her little brother to school
I be gettin' bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on sex
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food
UGK sayin' peace out, and plenty of luck
And she could keep usin' Pimp C, uh, just a use me up
Ah, hah, well oh, baby, baby, baby
(Yeah, a just use me up)
Baby, ah, hah, well oh

Smoke somethin', bitch, smoke somethin'
I'm up early 'cuz my nigga don't sell dope after night time
Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch, holla at yo' bitch, now yo' bitch on my team
Got her buyin' us sticky green, lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch, you lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boyz, that's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today
Pro smoke, pro choke, anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take it, trick, I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya
Rollin' Seville

Marijuana fields
(Marijuana fields)
Grippin' my steal, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
They tellin' me, "Bun, don't go there", but man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas but scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout or smokin' that joint 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain, and leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em from P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em, wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em to hell, to heaven
I just spent 60 G's on a brand new Eldo-reeze
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac, north star fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke when my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch 'cuz I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant, '84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed down Screw tapes that knock, blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks, try 20 ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas
'N got big ass diamonds off in they teeth
Fifth wheel and grill

(Nigga, I'm so real)
Bitch, how you feel? Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel
Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play, it don't change, ain't a thang to say
It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go
Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers, body rockers
Late night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerrilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us
Touched like Midas, these bitch ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch ass niggas ain't got no cheese?
Blowin' big kill
(Blowin' big kill)
Million dollar deals
(Million dollar deals)
Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Uh, puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J
Smoke somethin', bitch
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Well it's big Bun Beeda I built the track
With girls with tens and the bitches back
It ain't nowhere fans a bunch with these sluts
Just shake your butts and bring back that stack (stack)
The mack is back and he's sittin on chrome
with a piece of chain or Herringbone or nugget (nugget)
That don't mean him a real live hoe
You ain't ready to roll then go on then, fuck it
Out them ducats, hoes better recognize
Niggaz better recollect, Bun finna regulate
I hit yo' town (what) find me a hoe stroll
Leave that bitch dry and head to another state (hold up)
Me and my brother can't wait when it come to the red
Cause we about that cash, cash
So if we can't convince ya we'll take your sister
Hit the highway and mash
You got, bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got, bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got, bitches that can and you got bitches that cain't
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch
Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care
I like the girl with the pussy hair
My partner Mike Mo like the pussy bare
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swang Big Dick, swang Sweet Jones
Go and get the myth out the cobra head
Girl got down you niggaz scared
I got a young yellow bitch, I'ma sing it loud
With a four-inch corner of jet-mink hair
Between her legs is where it great
And get the money out the nigga when she go on a date
I stay caked up, rocked up
Magnum rubbers stay socked up
I ain't tryin to get the wet dick
Hold my good but she ain't that slick
I know you want this high-dollar cum
Bitch know I got money, wanna get her some
Bitch you must, done lost your mind
The trick's niggaz over there, you better get on the grind
Bitches not flexin ain't much good
I should and I would keep clear if I could
But when I do I just CAWN'T get away
Cause I gotta fuck all day every day
That leaves me run loco for real
All these chickenheads lie about deal
Ain't gotta do it up to make me chill
Find a good spot on the floor and kneel!
Know that my heart's in between my fires
Though I can't take when they look in my eyes
Lookin for love that's no surprise
Comin up off, that's family ties
Then I hit it from the back, all the way
Slap that back and just lock cross say
Not freeze out without no delay
Girls in the chat, I ain't got shit to say
<SONGEND>

Ain't nobody trippin' 'cause the money already made

The drop top Jag or the candy red Impala
Sellin' big cheese, keep pushin', my nigga
Polo horses on my bed-fuck Hilfiga
I'm Pimp C bitch, in the ghetto, I'm a star
I made this for the niggas tryin' ta chop in they cars

Now, when I turn my knock up, and bangin' yo' block up
Without pickin' my Glock up, I'm raisin' my stock up
I got haters on lock-up boy, they slangin' rock up
And bangin' Makaveli 7, crankin' my 'Pac up
Now, ain't no stoppin' when the tops start droppin'
Hearin' Fat Pat rappin', your hat back capin'

I'm puffin' on the 'dro, I got the pistol in the do'
I pulled up in my ride, these hoes lookin' hot
If she get up on my leatha, then her panties gon' drop

Got some prime cut cock, I mean some private ass stock
I just can't stop bleedin' my block
Got some prime cut cock, I mean some private ass stock
I just can't stop bleedin' my block
Got some prime cut cock, I mean some private ass stock
They put it in they mouth and never say,"No"
Some nut suckin' hoes, I mean some dick suckin' pros
That like to get exposed, and play with they nose
And bend they pussy over, for my nigga, and touch they toes
She do that shit for daddy, but them tricks gotta pay
Just like E 40 Pimpin' in a major way
It's all for the money, she tryin' ta stay paid
Steady breakin' niggas on them shiny ass thangs
It's all for the money, she tryin' ta stay paid
Steady breakin' niggas on them shiny ass thangs
It's all for the money, she tryin' ta stay paid
Steady breakin' niggas on them shiny ass thangs

Got yo' bitch wetter than the captain of the swim team
Steppin' out the Caddy, bitch, I'm fresher than Dentyne
Slicker than Crisco, sweeter than Nabisco
From Philly to 'Frisco where the Don be a Sisqo
You better get some blades if you still ridin' this ho
Boys puttin' Swangers on Benzes, it gotta stop
If you fittin' ta ride foreign, then, nigga, you gotta chop
And Southern niggas still got the nerve to ride D's
I ain't hatin' on Daytons, but it's 2000, nigga please
It's all about the candy paint, it's all about the Vogues
It's all about the slab, baby, it's all about the hoes
Got some cars and some pros some real and some fraud
Hated on by a nigga, hated on by a broad
So long as J's sell, and them boppin' hoes slut
I'll be ridin' chromin' blades, steady choppin' hoes up
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?

Ain't from Atlanta but I know these hoes like me
They pulling on my zipper wanna bite me
I got a bitch from Oakland like to get hyphe

With the juicy tank top and a loop of ten heels
All bullshit aside, she looking ready to kill

I'm talking beating the pussy up while the headboards knock
She ain't watching the clock, ain't finna answer the phone

Put your feet in the sky, bring your knees to your chest
Grab a hold to the sheets, bitch, and I'ma do the rest
Get to pressing on your pink, gripping on your soft
To the side, take a ride, from the back I break you off
I want some pussy and some navel and some ass and some mouth

Quit loven her, leave college, no, quit stopping

Be afraid to fall, cause Life is

Feel like they're starting fires
And igniting flames, anything

Taken for a conviction of triple
Murder, Rubin Carter's life was murdered,
Just like a black man criticized for controversy
Sometimes I start my own, most lies do hurt me
Coming down like a homicide victim,
Just cause I look and sound different
Comin down like James Bond, I'm on another
Mission 005.7 like the rate of homicide victims
Violent crimes are hard to retire, they never Will
I am fucking legend even if I am killed

Be in high school was a jock
A homecoming king, a volley-
Ball player, a boxer, a rockstar, a Rodney King
But no rapper has me beat
An actor, a rocker, a baseball
Player, a professional wrestler
Similar to Brock Lesnar
Even a ladies man, a bodybuilder
Once again a boxer, a skilled dribbler
A debater, snowboarder
A triathlete, a break dancer
Now I hate dancing, a wake boarder
Even a cheerleader, more like
A peer mediator, Who am I
Where's my first breath
Took profound leaps in every step,
I was even into football, ob course
Basketball, bring it soccer, even tennis
Can't stop winning, it's addictive
Life is a game board until you finish it
Even a lifeguard, but I still can't swim

<SONGSTART>So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F**k it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C:)
Sweet jones
My bitch a choosey lover, never f**k without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like the f**k for 40 dollars in the club
f**king up the game, bitch you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Bun B:)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B U N B
Cause what's a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoes?
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get jones
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi:)
Eni mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-saw pole
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b**** is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, walk it off from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
I, I choose you baby
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>PA, TA and I keep yelling it but y'all don't hear me though
On the cool, I'm trying to tell them it be the place
That I be laying low, lamping in my hometown
Niggaz ain't trippin', so I gets to keep my chrome down
And I be dippin' around the spots that niggaz pass
Swisha's, serving to the fiends, calling me
Mr. Big Buns, snatching checks from your momma
Making dollars, hoes holla, hustling bring ya drama
Uh but I don't sweat it fool, I come from where the best ride
Ain't no punks where I'm from on that West side
PA nigga, outta town with big nuts
Where outta town motherfuckers lose they life on the cut
But we ain't trippin', pass that dipplin'
And it's gonna be all right, soon as I get fried tonight
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
Well, I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm smoking big fat dank
I don't fuck around no mo with that goddamn drank
But every time I get down with my nigga Big Mike
We go and get a bottle of that Dom all night
I got that green monster baby, can you buy that?
Plus I got Swisha suit for days, you wanna try that?
I roll them, most of them big and fat they look like ball bats
I live in P A T, the East side, niggas sayin' jack
These laws be trippin' 'cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it in cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living a Mac
And I ain't trippin', flippin' then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
'Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes

'Fore I fly high, lookin at them jackers in their eye (eye)
I remember when a rapper was a go getta (go getta)
Now all these rappers is some hoe niggaz (uh!)
Hide behind the guards at the show nigga (uh!)
Don't want no pussy, homosexual, on the low nigga
That's y'all (that's y'all), I from the old school (uh!)

Got boppers that's steady jockin, goofy niggaz in my ear
Bitch I'ma self-made trillionaire, get your soft ass outta here
Weak niggaz wanna plead their case (case), just to raise up out my face (face)
I ain't got that time to waste, punch your mouth and knock out the taste
You MySpacin and Facebookin, playin games with them toys
I'm in the streets where gangstas meet, while you're online with them boys
So step your game up, build your name up, quit your talkin and quit your doin
All that planning and contemplating. when the f**k you gon' start pursuing?
Cars ain't driving themselves, mansions ain't building themselves
They waiting for Annie Mae and they need to stop feelin themselves
They wealth ain't comin until they earn it
But that somethin they won't know 'til they learn it, while burnin...
(Pimp C)
I'ma tell you pussy niggaz once again (once again)

<SONGSTART>Uhhhhhhhh ~!
If you know like I know you would get down on the flo'
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisha full of 'dro
We can get down for my dime and we can f**k, on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha f**kin with me fo'?
Every lady ain't a hoe and every hoe ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't f**k around with no punks
Ride with me she holdin a pistol while I'm whippin and poppin the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems 'long as she hear what the f**k I said
Pimpin ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here livin by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm lookin at you you choosin me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm superstar, we headed to the top
(Chorus: sung)
I'm stayin true, I'm out here whippin my Mercedes
F**kin with the midnight ladies - the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm bangin Screwwww, my young girl lookin fine
We stayin out here on the grind - and keepin money on our mi-ii-iind
(Bun B:)
Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, gotta feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster-ass persona so hard it can dent, steel
In the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leakin fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust

Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leakin out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you gotta go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Gotta pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Gotta play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's yo' turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a f**k how you feel
(Chorus)
(Pimp C:)
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the SOOOOOOOOOUTH
This scary hoe don't wanna know what it's ABOOOOOOOOUT
Cause I stay country true down to the co', dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws, feel it tighten up don't stop don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars, f**k the D.A. f**k the law
I f**k the snow but I love a pro like flatbackers I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer, drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker, bitch around me man I'ma mack her
(Bun B:)
From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of 'dro and Impala bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki', and ten kilos grams in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's one point five mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is tickin, time is pressin
No second guessin, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK
(Chorus)
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S H O R T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be living naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell
I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fucking maker
'Cause I ain't taking, no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts
Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch
This dope ain't yo dope and these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafucking guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafucking road
And don't even try to come back nigga, yo
'Cause me Dre and C got fingers on a fat trigger
We making too much money moving weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper booming cold blow yo ass up
And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailing on yo bitch ass
But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas
Niggaz on the track dropping shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cooking up some llello for the local drug king
The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slanging some more white dust
Real, oh, so trill, the life's no glamor
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fucking up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home
And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales
Stupid muthafuckas smoking dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fighting Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops finding my stash, yo what could the worst be
Through so going undercover then turning dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Calling my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas
I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't 'bout to sell no fucking dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope but you still ain't selling shit
Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon' let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafucking cuts
So step in like I said before, we'll take them muthafucking nuts
Ask the last nigga brought his fucking ass down
Trying to sell that fucking dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'm a go to Port Arthur and run them fucking niggaz
Brought his fucking gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac
Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope
Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
'Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafucking killas
So have your shit attached, before you come check us
Pimp C, bitch, P.A. home, Short Texas

Roll like a stone, like my name Mick Jagger
Say it befo', had to tell you hoes again
Run a drum machine, like my name Roger Men

UHH...
Dedicated to all the underdogs, knahmtalkinbout?
Muthafuckas told me I wasn't gon be shit...
Told me I was gon be able to do this rap shit...
Knahmtalkinbout? My own family talked down on me, knahmsayin?
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (My uncle told me I wasn't gon be shit)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (I used to walk around with a bag full of rappers)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
(Motherfucker told me, a nigga from Texas couldn't make no record)
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
(Then after I made the record, muh'fuckers said they would never give us no respect)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... (But now they tryna rap like us)
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah... (Tryna be like us, tryna smell like us)
(Knahmtalkinbout?)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money... (Check this out)
[Pimp C:]
Man I refuse to let the bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up, but they cain't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a hoe open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a hoe for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
(right... right...)
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (hmm...)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (hmm...)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho...
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money...
[Pimp C:]
To all the babies havin babies on ya' own
I know you feelin fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, "Ya fucked up your life"
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy with lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggaz tellin you, "Ya crazy"
"What you thankin? You too young to have a family"
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggaz ain't gon ride witchu
But get down with that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin
It's time to change sumthin...
[Chorus]
[Pimp C:]
If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, "It ain't enough room in the NBA"
You tell them haters, "Save that bullshit for another day"
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, "You ain't gon make it", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase to hog it up, the lawyer end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be shame and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right...
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
... (Uh!)

I got money on my beeper, dead trees on my phone
They call me Mick Jagger 'cause I 'Roll a lot of stones'
It's a whole lot of clones but only one Sweet Jones
Turnin' whores to carnivores, they just can't leave my meat alone
It's been a long time since I busted on a glock
But every corner that I hit, I left it screwed up and chopped
Marooned up and dropped, like my Biarritz on top
Let the motherfucker bleed until it drip and let it drop
I'm still that young boy that had a pocket full of stones
But now I'm sick and simply rich, grippin' wood and flippin' chrome
I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key

Man I pull up in your city and get my Bush on
Lay down the competition, take their cash crops and get my push on
Moved up to Bentley with more chrome from a Lexus key
All because we cornered the market on that Texas tee
And we don't bar no plexes, we way bigger than other men though
The diamond deuces on tinted windows, we in the wind yo
We 'Chevro way' the wind blow, that's the corner we been Joe
Don't know where you been bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though
When it's ten fo', good, but in my Styrofoam good and muddy
We block bleeders, leavin' your neighborhoods good and bloody
We grippin' that woodler, bud it, sit back and scope it
Pay attention to Prince and pushin' everything about to pump it

Uh, I done smashed up my flyin' spurt, it wasn't shit
I just parked it in the grass and brought some brand new shit
A Phantom Rolls Royce, 24's with the bump
I ain't trippin' about the seat, I got them woofers in my trunk
Cut in my swisher, codeine on my whiskers
Fuckin' with that Smoke D, Bundy and that Vicious
UGK Records, it's an institution
Know a lot of niggaz livin' off of prostitution
Pimpin' ain't dead, it just moved to the web
Bitch ain't gotta hit the track, ain't gotta give no tricks no head
Ain't got to give no tricks, no pussy, just cameras and screams
Easiest money you can get, it's the American Dream bitch
Man I'm a middle finger figure, a million dollar mission
Poppin' like Orville Redenbacher, with a whippin' in the kitchen
Yayo like Dontrelle Willis, we the trillest on the mound
I'm holdin' that whole South down, I know you feel us
We the realest walkin' the planet
Can't stand it, pass away, wanna fight us
Start to swingin', wanna kill us, blast away, wanna stab us
Get to stickin but make sure you cut us deep
'Cause I betcha we comin' back a couple hundred brothers deep
Pimp and Bun, we run the streets, which streets? Man, pick your hood
Don't matter, we represented, cross us? We gon' get you good
Them Down South veterans, ain't nobody better than
Gonna tell your next of kin or your brethren, let us in cousin

Lookin good spendin some nigga G's
Nails by Vietnamese, [unverified], lookin' like they worth G's
Dress above they knees, jellies and G-strings up the ass
Man I never let 'em pass
So, tell me where can I find 'em
With they nigga or in that candy Cadillac right behind him
Bitches tellin' me see yo' dick grand
All she wanna do is ride Su-bur-ban
Put her ass on the leather and rub the wood
See we got boppers in Texas oh, man that pussy look good
So, I let them hoes ride and I show them a grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
When she told me I looked good I didn't feel no pride
All the bitch wanted to do is just fuck my ride
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car

An attribute put up in they head by they momma
Oh yeah, I'ma tell it like it is, I sees how it goes down
Niggaz talkin' 'bout, how they passin' these hoes 'round
But y'all trickin', them hoes told me
Fools y'all ain't Goldy, ridin' in a goodie but an oldie
Fifty dollars there, a hundred dollars here
You brought the bitch a drink and all her homegirls a beer
Your homeboys lookin for ya, but yo' ass gone
You left your niggaz at the club and took all them hoes home
And didn't even fuck, man what the fuck
If you didn't want to fuck then get the fuck up out the truck
You know what I mean? I ain't showin out Vogues
Just so these hoes can be seen, c'mon you wanna fuck or cut?
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
When you look at my chrome and you lick your lips
It's just like I'm rubbin' my dick between your hips
And when you smile and shake your ass, my grill smile right back
Bitch I'm the real, that's why I ride Cadillac
And I'ma fuck you and fuck all yo' friends
Soon as Pimp C come through in that 600 Benz
With burgundy paint, butter and LG rims
Color TV, VCR playin X-rated films
Of myself, runnin up in beauty queens
But let me tell y'all niggaz the difference between y'all and me
You see, man I can tell all that bitch wanted to do
Is just ride for free and smoke for free
But bitch not me, you better ask them hoes if my name Pimp C
Unless your pussy makin ten thousand dollars a week
The only way I see you sittin in my passenger seat, you bitch!
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar

the highway was so wet, i'm slippin' out my lane
the bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
i bet you never seen a big truck like that
i bet you never got a dick sucked like that
the bitch didn't know that i was tapin' the whole scene
now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen
the glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
i got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
tryin' to close me down, but i got ghetto love
i'm pimp c bitch, i'm comin' down richer than rich

Chorus:

Verse 2 (bun-b):
We flippin' worldwide, p.a.t. international jetsetters

but don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
breakin' off the jealous with pitch black barettas

bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex

a one-way ticket to something bigger than you
over your head and got scared

mafioso puttin' bombs under my load
never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
now i'm comin' down shinin'

Top drop down, top top drop down

[Pimp C:]
When the top starts fallin the bitches start callin
My trunk start bangin and the fo's start crawlin
The drank mixed up, in the cream soda bottle
Her lips, hit my dick that's why I smashed on the throttle
Swisha Sweet candy, Robert Davis in my cup
I'm swervin like Bootsy but I couldn't give a fuck (fuck)
You see this car? (You see this car?)
You see this truck? (You see this truck?)
They both for me now watch them girls get buck (buck)
Ain't shit friendly but we still have fun (fun)
UGK for life, you know the Pimp and the Bun (Bun)
The great state of Texas, candy in the Lexus
Dick for them hoes jaws, pistols for the flexers
Somebody asked me why I'm ridin on the East
All I did was told the truth, the bullshit niggaz cease (cease)
If you ain't hatin nigga why the fuck you mad?
If your records ain't sellin, get your fingers out ya ass, bitch!
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Well it's the king of the trill (trill) wood wheel in my palm (palm)

The granddaddy kush mixed with a little O.G. (fo' sho')
That's my breakfast, off top I gotta blow three
Not to mention codeine, liquid and the pill (pill)
Bloats on my grill with my hand on my steel (steel)
Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing
I'ma gon' and pop the trunk, surely but slowly
Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your Colby Jet system (no)
Your slab ain't holdin, ain't no use to you frontin
And I'm fin' to shut the game down when I push the button
And the... [echoes]
[Chorus]
[Cory Mo:]
Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang
Cory Mo about to do the damn thaaaaang
In the butter guts with the diamond in the back
King Kongs in the trunk, hit the switch and watch it crack
I'ma let my paper stack and quote nothin but facts
So don't "ax" me nothin partner 'less you droppin some cash (cash)
Now she hoppin it fast (fast) that's just how I like it (like it)
Turn around and show me somethin girl I'm gettin excited (oooh)
Ain't nobody trippin cause the money already made

And let my top drop dowwwwwn

Pop pop muthafucka there you go

Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack
So you gon' give me my money but you don't hear me though
But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes
P.A. nigga, trill ass nigga
How you figga you can buck me down nigga?

Instead of buying cars for a bitch named sunshine
Give me what's mine, give me what's mine
Before it come down to triggas
Shit, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Bitch, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Uh, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
But you can't hear me
It's the return of the trill ass niggas bitch
Yea muthfuckas, I figured you run
I figured you run, when I pull triggas to guns
That triggas to guns P.A. fool a nigga named Bun
A nigga named Bun, no more sun, no more shine
Say hello to the nine milly millameter
(Buck, buck, buck)
Money tight glock, bustin' them shots
When I break yo ass off somethin' hot
Niggas steady catchin' lead to the head
I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin' bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin', niggas start passin' away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise, I'm gettin' Chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now it's the return of the trill ass niggas

Boy, used to come up from the rags to the riches
Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches
But now it's like the game is full of nothin' but some snitches
And wanna be gangsters that's scared to put 'em in ditches
Fed's takin' pictures so the cameras go click
And video rollin' while I'm holdin' my dick
They follow me around like they doin' they job
But while you watchin' me how many people gettin' robbed
Lets keep it trill 'cause we already know

Throw your money in the air and let 'em know

You could roll with the playas on the million dollar mission, c'mon
Uhh, hey mama, I'm a tell you what the deal is

He ain't teachin you nothin, you need to learn me
Check out my mind, I'm 24 on the grind

With the feminine fat, in all the right places
She look me in my eyes and she make all the right faces
Cause she's a real catch, we make a tough pair
A true dynamic duo and we up there
We sittin tall at the top
And if she ride or die for me playa I'm a give her all that I got
I break her off and not, let her hold the keys
I don't take her out of town, man I take her oas
It ain't trickin if you spend it on your lady
Bring the bacon home to baby and everything'll be gravy
Just let me know if that's soundin like a plan
Cause all you really need to change your life is the man
And you appealin to the King of the Trill and

[Bun B]
A bad day for the niggaz in my click
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It's seems the drug situation is so tow up
And poes down the fuckin T-X had to show up
I got shit on the scene so 99 can't hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret and there's no rest
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
In Dynasties.I-ROCs... and Caravans and muthafuckas are swolen
Like paper stacks and a rubberband
Goin all out of tact on the local bird slaggin brothaman
And be servin as slow as fuck
Cause my niggaz are nervous
and if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggaz is happy with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town
Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my tags off my buick and yall know I didn't love that
Rollin on some white balls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, YOU GOTS TO DO YOUR OWN NAILS!
I told my niggaz to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town
God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back up!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my click
Got the birds, and reopen my lab back up
And told my boys, "If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye,
Don't give him a chance to identify!"
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at random, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Close to the dopeman - God damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
CAUSE IN MY YARD IS A BIG ASS - I GOT YALE SIGN!
It's time for TONY MONTANA stacks
I got niggaz on the corner holdin big ass bags and cans of crack
The land of Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fools run in with your glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last love
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight lights
when the feds in town
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

Comin' down on the slab, boy
Ridin' dirty, for real tho, ridin' dirty
Have you ever been rollin' in a clean ass 'Lac
Blowin' big out the window, everybody got a sack
Got my heat right between my seat, got a box of them thangs
In case these fools start playin' with me
You'd be surprised how them boppers wink, girl, I can't stop
Give my headlights a blink and roll them up out the top
And keep movin' and keep rollin'
Fools that don't be holdin' I'm comin' through and foldin'
And I can't stand snitches, wanna kill all of y'all
Even though some bustas fall I'm still rollin' like a ball
And having things my way, hittin' that highway
Sellin' that big yay, a plush-ass place to stay
Police, they wanna run in
Talkin' on cell phones got a lotta kids done in
I wanna live like Arnold, Willis and Mr. Drummond
And keep my paper sturdy, big birds and tight herbs
Fool, I'm ridin' dirty
Big birds and tight herbs, fool I'm ridin' dirty
Ridin' dirty, fool, ridin' dirty
Tell me can you feel it? Man, nothin' can save ya
I believe it's that season for gettin' yo papers
Or haven't you heard about them birds? We call it that cheese
In Texas we get it with ease, hit I-10 if you please
But these polices, they think they sharp as creases
For no reasons, man, they straight up strippin' cars to pieces
Out of suspicion or if they thinkin' you on a mission
Ain't no wishin' or prayin', they sayin' assume the position
Hands behind ya head, down on ya knees
You get the case and they get yo weight and yo G's
Come on, I use to ride the Port Arthur city streets
With a chick with pretty feets and a box of Philly Sweets
They tried to finish me but couldn't get it done
So somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty
Man, somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty

Tell 'em like this, ya better get up out my camp dude
Befo' I have to pull my gat and get, real rude
I don't figure that it's worth gettin hurt
Just 'cause ya gal wanna give me that skirt
Bet it feels funny when ya doin 69
Knowin that ya sippin on all my jimmy wine
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bad
Knowin that ya swallowed all the skeeter that I had?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda shot you up instead I told ya somethin good
[Chorus: sampled from Chaka Khan & Rufus' "Something Good"]
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah... yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
[Bun B:]
Aiyyo, what's up with that bulge in ya khakis?
You wanna pack a gat, but you STILL ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gangload of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cause by yourself, you're runnin to the flo'
I seen your kind befo', man ya nothin with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin when ya chillin with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin up some daisies
See crazy you wanna be, but punks with no heart, they ain't hard
They just waitin for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep your weak self locked in ya hood
Cause without your boys I'm a have to tell ya somethin good
[Chorus]
(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)
[Pimp C:]
Brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check ya girl and what she did in the past
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her REAL fast
But I don't trust the dugout, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check ya blood and let somebody check your teeth
But if you don't step, I'm a drop on ya fast
And pump off bullets like government cash
I didn't do ya girl but your sister was alright
Took her to my homeboy's Caddy last night [girl moaning in the background]
She waxed my jimmy, and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit if from the back, and the girl just THREW ME
Told me, "Pump it harder, " and she scratched me on my BOOTY
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty lil' girl
[Chorus 1/2]
[Bun B:]
Let's talk about these half-n-half punks
By day they sorry bastards, at night they talkin bout, poppin trunks
Butter .25 cain't keep you alive
From a sawed-off, fool so I hope you survive
See bluffin might save ya tail one day
But who's ta say, it won't catch ya next week, on the runway?
You might shoot a few shots in the wind
But the same time tomorrow, you'll be runnin again
Now can you keep it up, every damn night?
You steady runnin to the argument but runnin from the fight
What's the deal man? Why don't you take your Raiders cap off?
Cause one of these days, you gonna getcha head slapped off
You cain't keep a crew cause they gettin sick of seein you bail
Like a punk'll hit the backstreet trail
And the women don't like you cause ya act like them
And that's why your little jimmy never went fo' a swim
Ya talk about slangin, makin G's
But I saw a fiend chase ya from, BJ's up to Mickey D's
Now everyday punks get took
Either for they dough, they'll ride 'em for the powder that they cook
You bookin from the scene cause ya couldn't hold ya own
A 40 ounce bottle slams, ya dead to your dome
Now you want revenge, so ya get your automatic
Find a group of hard-heads, and startin kickin static
Ya pulled ya little chrome but these fools got gats
Try to run and caught two buckshots in ya back
Now you nothin but a memory that's gone in a slayin
So when I tell you somethin good, punk I don't be playin

Be there four deep... hella clan

Yo' bitch is out of pocket,
'Cause yo' pimpin' was scary;
Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy.
Fuck niggas watch them mack and pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what y'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'.
This is the conclusion: pimpin' ain't no illusion.

Bun B:
If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her,
'Cause a beggar ain't a muthafuckin' chooser.
Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean.
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a wif a this...
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior... and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny... sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again... that's why...
[Chorus: x2]
Too $hort:
You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money... it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game.
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it.
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin'...beeyatch.
[Chorus: x3]
...pimpin' ain't no illusion
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part."
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it"
"Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets"
"Had to tie her to a rocket"
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up"
"Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up"
"(Shit)"

That hoe can go 'head, if she ain't feelin' it
She ain't goin' nowhere, she love how I'm drillin' it

Keepin' me a pro, next to my fo'
Instead of stackin' cheese
He steady screamin' to that hoe, let me see it
Fuck ass nigga, fuck ass nigga

They diamonds ain't shinin' and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm grippin' on the grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm workin' wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville, your step daddy can get killed
If he keeps talkin' shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you tryin' to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the South
For them niggas and them girls with them golds in they mouth
The boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill, bitch you ain't what this about, about
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit

We ain't got nothin' to gain but I got everythin' to lose
So I'm forever bring the blues to the issue
Pick and choose if I miss ya, stick and move when I diss ya
Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, it was made for me to gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my
Flow fly, dope my, wait awhile you know why? Why?
Too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars, baby ballin'
Bullshitter, frontin' like rottweiliers, no bark, no bite
But showin' thangs, talkin' loud like they knowin' thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane, your ass mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight, it ain't no passin' tonight

Waitin' for me to fall but yet they comin' off the wall
Till I'm ready, keep the gun steady and ready
For anybody crossin' the line with get that fuck shit

Got the radio on pump when I come through a slump

With a rusty ass niner lookin' for trouble

<SONGSTART>Hold up
It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital
Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that
There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?"
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'

No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers

And most of y'all niggaz ain't nothing but tricks

Niggaz wanna do my dirt
Balling down on Beale Street
Sipping on a pint of syrup
Chopping up the chronic weed
Picking all the fucking seeds

In my trunk I got them fucking keys
Always riding Chevy things
Shining on them twanky things
Kids I'm a role model
Police I'm a dope man
Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead

Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash

Pussy nigga, I pack that nine everytime and I ain't trying dying
I just wanna celebrate
Cause trill niggaz don't die
Pussy nigga, thinking you gon kill me

Putting dick up in your daughter, rap is over I serve some cheese
Nigga talking bout, robbing Chad
Run up on me with that first, will leave you stinking in the grass
If your calico to mask, if you Baptist go to church
See a hoe up in a nigga, gon pull up a skirt
That'll be, some incredible shit
Niggaz scheming on my bezel, on some devilish shit
I been to hell and back, on another level you bitch
Go on try it I'm going live, they gon need a shovel for you bitch
I been stabbed I been shot, went from no fans to being hot
But somehow always fall short, for trying to keep fiddles in my pot
In a dog eat dog world, y'all fellas be chasing girls
When I place myself in history, too hot for a ladder to catch me
But I can't help but to notice, I'm one of the coldest
And I know y'all haters love when I'm locked up, but I won't lose focus
Yeah I wrote this counting down, how many days I got
So lately my gun ain't been hid, it's been displayed a lot
My attitude is fucked up, I don't give a fuck cause I just don't give one
Thinking bout living a life where everything you do right is wrong, mo'fucker I live one
I know niggaz wanna kill me, but I'm still riding pride
Cause the Lord riding with me, and that's the main reason why
Some niggaz win, and some niggaz lose
Some niggaz getting bruised, some always crying to blues
Some niggaz already lost, and ain't gon lose no mo'
Big shoes hoe choose, ain't paying dues no mo'
Everything y'all trying to do, I built a school hoe
Now it's fly to talk country, I made the rules hoe
I was sagging in my khaki's, 'fore Dickies cool
Gangsta Nike's on my feet, our music banging in the streets
The young B.G.'s, really love to thump
Fuck radio and BET, I'm out here bumping in the trunk
For the girls popping pussy, and the boys with the blow
Cadillac'ers and flat-backers, I'm out here repping for it hoe
Can't any man, boy or woman take away my soul
It's a gift given from God, and I'm keeping a tight hold
The world is ugly and cold, trying to make me the same
But I'ma keep it one hundred, when it come to the game
Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up
We keep it click tight, so when niggaz start lurking
In the dark heaters start, anybody start jerking
Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg
A dragging society, don't borrow don't beg
For tomorrow so gon 'head with your pity, I'ma be cool
Kindergardeners was looking up to me, in pre-school
Down with Pimp C fool, and P-A-T the town
Representing it to the fullest, till I'm gone I hold it down
Bun Beater, would never sell you no lie
So if you ask for the truth, I'ma reply to trill niggaz don't die

(cocaine cocaine) UGK, UGK bitch my man Bun B
Pimp C in the house y'all, put your hands together
Big Dick Cheney and Snowy Snow, (cocaine cocaine)
(Pimp C:)
Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggaz, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'ma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose
Cocaine, cocaine
(Bun B:)
They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Columbia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine
(Rick Ross:)
You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
And my yayo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

That means Raplete's infection
If you play against me, synonym of ill
Opposite of well, can't anticipate me
You're in a position to fail
If you're not sick, as far or rhyming
Or studying to go to College
Don't be hiding, call in Mr.

The trunk poppa, ready to break y'all off somethin' proper
You know I'm a villain so why try?
Fuck a glock, I'm throwin' a glock party, darin' niggas to drive by
I came to smoke a son of a bitch that went for his but didn't pull it
Fast enough and got blasted up with a bullet
I'm snipin', I got you in my scope so what's the use of tryin' to bail?
I'm ready to catch a case but not for yayo, for a murder, mayne
187 ways to rip ya spine out anytime you wanna test
Say you never heard of pain? Wait till I pull my nine out
And empty out a clip in yo chest cavity
Haven't we been known for takin' it
To the sucka muthafuckas that was fakin' it
Makin' it known I gots my chrome in my ride
And I'm fried, PA nigga worldwide from the Westside, fool
Yeah, I'm serious and this is one of three sixteens
Yeah, ya bastards, I'm serious, this is only one of three sixteens
Straight up, I'm serious that was only one of three sixteens
Now check this shit out
It's DJ DMD, back with that funk flowin' lazy
Kinda crazy, never letting niggas fade me, I'm a little fast on the trigga
Niggas, I get my blast on nightly, you don't wanna fight me
Take yo ass on down the block, I keeps my shit cocked
So knock on wood 'cuz shit could get hot
On this spot, some niggas catchin' lead shots
'Cuz ain't no wipin' off these red dots
Now try me if you think I won't bust
Shots to ya dome will leave ya ass in the dust, nigga
'Cuz ain't nobody droppin' bigger hits
I'm makin' tracks upon, track upon, tracks to make these niggas shit
And I'm down with some fa sho, niggas
So tell me how you gon' diss me with a clique full of ho niggas?
You keep yo ass in yo muthafuckin' set
Or take a slug in ya muthafuckin' chest, Reggie
Mark ass nigga, ya punk bitch
I'm serious and this is two of three sixteens
Ya punks, I'm serious, this is two of three sixteens
Punk ass niggas, I'm serious, this was two of three sixteens
Sixteen number three
Some muthafuckas think they can go with me
But most of them niggas just some hoes to me
I got a lotta niggas that's down with me
But too many niggas like to clown with me
They act like they know me but they really don't
They ask me to come kick it but they know I won't
I see they ass in PA, they don't know me
I see they ass in Houston, I'm they homie
But nigga, how it feel to be a ho?
Gettin' yo ass kicked at every muthafuckin' show
Tryin' to be a gangsta but nigga you's a fool
And tryin' to kick it with me, like me and y'all cool
But nigga, let's see if you can with that chrome
I shoulda popped yo ass when you rolled into my home
But bitch niggas steal and G niggas mack
And busta ass niggas gettin' bullets in they back
And that's a muthafuckin' fact
Ya little muthafucka, I'm serious
And that was three of three sixteens
For any niggas that wanna test

Or if you bitches wanna hear some more of this
Lock your bedroom door trick, pick up your cordless
You can suck a mean dick, lick a good ball
And if I keep on fuckin, you'll keep on callin

And I apologize for puttin' tears inside them eyes
When I wasn't fair didn't compromise
Put you in fear when I told them lies
How I love to dive inside them thighs I love your cockiness
Ain't gonna ask if you roll in rap you know this right it's obvious
I'm an Underground King with a winner down
Queen I'm fin' to let her know
This ain't about bling, this ain't about cream, I never let her go
We smokin' love, you know what's up
This for the real women, that's you? Throw it up
'Cause your man's so focused
You rub your lips lovin' the bub 'cause I open you up
You got my back whether broke or re-up
In the crush limousine 'cause we rollin' up
This for the real women
(The solid ladies and the pros)
But the real women
(They play the game like they suppose)
They the real women
(The queens holdin' down they kings)
They the real women
(So go on girl do yo' thang)
This for the real women
(The solid ladies and the pros)
But the real women
(They play the game like they suppose)
They the real women
(The queens holdin' down they kings)
They the real women
(So go on girl do yo' thang)
Uh, you was down from the get-go
I put it down with them silly hoes
Ridin' tryin' to get the dirty do'
Didn't know what my life was gon' have in sto'
'Til my karma came
And you was right there tryin' to have my thangs
When the chips all fell down
You was the only one I had around
Saved my life when I was 'bout to drown
Girl you my queen, come and get your crown
Now I keep you with the nice thangs
VVS ice blings, 10-karat diamond rings
If I ain't tell you with the biz
Girl you my baby 'til the end
And I'ma treat you like a king supposed
Keep you ridin' Rolls slammin' matchin' do's
This for the real women
(The solid ladies and the pros)
But the real women

They the real women

<SONGSTART>(Andre 3000 with "I choose you babe!" in the back)
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F*** it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that b**** do you dirty
we'll wipe her a** out and send detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C)
Sweet jones
My b**** a choosey lover, never f*** without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for 40 dollars in the club
f***** up the game, b**** you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them b****es too scary
Your b**** chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Bun B)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
Because its greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
Im a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar b****
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C & B U N B
Cause whats a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoe
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose
OOOooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi)
Eeny mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl dont touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the C-Support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers couldn't stop the
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last pump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooooohhhhh Ooooooohhh
I chose you girl
IIIIiiii

Well, well, I know, I know, I know, yeah
Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin' crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper I gotta do it quick
Thinkin' I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin' wit, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live everyday like it's my muthafuckin' last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'ma die
But if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'ma take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say, "It'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
This world we livin' in man it ain't nuthin' but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya in New York niggas gettin' shot fo bombers
Now they got yo life in the former they in like California
Niggas wit dubs are hydroponic, marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pops died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wished it was twice mayn
I remember bein' eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not givin' a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' to the end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen fo damn near ten
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day you here but the next day you gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
I'm up early 'cuz ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets Peanut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin' shife, so shife back
Can't show no weakness wit these bitches life jacked
Mayn it's a trip where I stay especially for me
Them bitches tryin' to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga down in Florida Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I ain't no liar
My man BoBo jus' lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God why he let these killas live
And take my homeboy's son away
Man if you got kids show 'em you love 'em
'Cuz God jus might call 'em home
'Cuz one day you're here, the next day you're gone
I know, you know, well, well, yeah
La ra la ra, I know, yeah, yeah

<SONGSTART>I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pimpin' down the ave you know I'm lookin' tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that
Who's says he's going through a thang
When ya'll ain't never lied
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
When I hurt and try to hate 'cause she knows the thrill is gone
Say man, I stop smokin' with haters back in ninety four
But niggas thinkin' that a sweeps gone get the through my door
And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye to eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight
And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this away
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away
My dead homey momma's tear shit
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 503
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets just keep on gettin' live with me
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin' that
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains
It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to ESG and all the victims of the game
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I'm pimpin' through the ave. tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown, when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuck 'n' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
So it's your life

<SONGSTART>Hi life
We livin' that hi life
Hi life
We livin' that hi life
I'm tired livin' f**ked up, tired of livin' bad
Tired of grandmama telling me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm tryin to live up to the image
That she would want me to be
But I got one foot in the street and every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G but Niggas depend on me
It ain't fake to hit a 10 so niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushing cocaine niggas holding pistols
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20, 000 tryin' to turn it into a hundred, and ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas came to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch thinking she can ease my mind by suckin' my dick
Bitch make up for a minute cause that ship never last
In 1996 niggas is dyin' from layin' on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Easy-E died
And you be wonderin' why you niggas
Out there smokin'cri
I wish that I could tell y'aIl wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that nigga you know that I would be lyin'
And I been f**kin' pussy since the tender age of nine
It's gettin' to be a full-time job just tryin' to stay alive
And crack a scandalous smirk offended by the weed
Smoke comin' of my shirt
But I still put in work and front for my folks
'cause where I come from nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe
Some say that nigga's sellin' dope
And you know I ain't lyin' that just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the devil poke you
With his fork
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophet, f**kin' hoes
And gettin' paid
I'm looking for that
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life
You only got one life to live that's all they give us to do it
You could bullshit your way through it or stay true
It can be complicated cause niggas
Be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the people
In the lane get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive, take your positions
With pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dust
To see the only stretch rest see how we was left to be
Down these streets that we be on
Motherf**kers sleepin' on them corners that you be on
Probably because society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the f**k made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas sellin' that dank
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of the American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on who gives a damn
When you can't afford a turkey or ham
Livin' off of Ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab, it's far from me
To push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your man
And so instead of being without I'm hustlin' tryin' to
Get through these ungodly days
Thinkin' of ways to get the f**k out of this maze
A man'll commit a crime who the& f**k it crime pays
I'm goin' through a phase you don't go out until you
Out reason a motherf**ker
Gots to pour out this 40 on the curb, disturbed and
Left with no doubt in this mind
But still sometimes he don't know why he walkin' around just hopin'
He can get one more try to make it
It's a bullshit he goin' through but yo he gots,
You can't fake it to get the
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life

<SONGSTART>You lost yo' spot when you went pop
CD flopped, you ain't hot.
But the game been good to meeeee...
(Hol' up, hol' up bitch!)
You lost your cars, and yo' house
Now you sleep on yo' mama's couch
But the game been good to meeeee...
UHH, first album went platinum, now you can't go gold
Made ya deal with the devil, but you sold yo' soul
You rent a lotta cars, rent a mansion and them hoes
You say you sold your Phantom, bitch they took yo' Rolls
Get disrespected everywhere you go
Big bodyguards when you come for the shows
They already know you got shit on your name
Nigga, you a pussy, they gon' take yo' chain
Take yo' piece, rings and watch
You play rich, boy you need to stop
I ain't dissin nobody, no particular name
Ya shoe fit nigga, get the fuck up out the game - lil' BITCH!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
I'm a Down South MC, I'm cold on the mic
I say it how I feel and I do it how I like
I write what I see, what I do, and what I know
And keep it one hundred off top from the do'
Now whether at a show, in the booth, or on the street
No matter where I go and no matter who I meet
Everybody tryna tell me how they feel 'bout the South
On the cool, them haters need to shut they fuckin mouth
'Cause we grip grain, nigga we pop trunk
We to' straps and we ready for the funk
Some niggaz two-step, some niggaz dance
Some niggaz just ball wit' a bottle in they hands
Sell a couple ringtones niggaz, that's bread
You hatin on paper get that FUCK up out yo' head
Worryin 'bout my cheese, getcha own stack
It's goin down in the South, you don't like it
Click clack, motherfucker!
(Pussy nigguuuh.)
You got caught with that work on 10
Made a deal with the state to turn your foul partner in
But he took 15, befo' you could tell
He ain't witchu no mo' hoe, you got twenty in a cell
I sent you a lawyer, you ain't listened that time
Ain't no appeal, but they dropped it to five?
Who you had to fuck to give back that time?
Textin me from a cell phone - bitch, yo lost YO' FUCKIN MIND?
How dare you tryna get me on conspiracy, Jack?
If the feds hit me, I'ma hit yo' ass BACK!
You fight witcho tounge, I send 'em killa
Transcript writer, I'll kill you nigguuuh!
(Smoke sum'hin, bitch.)
Got caught with the shit, twenty years
Youse a snitch, you turned biiii-tch.

(Hol' up, bitch!)
I took yo' hoe, she's a pro
Bought me all, of yo' dough.
The game been good to meeeee...

"Got front and back, and side to side" ---> MC Ren
"Got front and back, and side to side"
"Got front and back, and side to side"
(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush inside ? ? is fresh
Triple gold double-A Dayton's is the best, ugh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cos where I'm from fool that's what everybody play
UGK-1 written smooth on my plates
Cos real pimp players don't never roll fake
I'm bout to hit Dove Way, get past Troy's
I'm dippin by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass by the Colt I see some women lookin fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the trigger so it bump, ugh
I know you player-hatin busters wanna ride man
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy
(Hook - x2)
(Pimp C)
It's pimpin pimpin, I'm hittin switches, checkin out my strap
but I keep on dippin, steady pimpin, kickin, how's about the winter man?
Makin sure these snitches, ain't stoppin riches, 5-Oh on my back
I'm chillin, hidin and winnin, pockets feelin fat
(Bun B)
And I come round your corner shinin, leanin, ever so sunnin
Gangstas put down their gun and
women and children come outside and start runnin
They catch a glimpse of the P-A pimp whoopin whips
Never goin out out like simps, walkin your block with gangsta limp
(Pimp C)
Some fool roll Lincoln, some fools roll Jag
but the crew from Texas roll them Lacs, white gloss and rags
With the candy paint and wheel and grill, and wooden dash
'94 I gotta keep it trill, down for my cash
(Bun B)
I gots my stash so I switches, keep on burnin
and these tyres keep on turnin
I be rollin through your scene, flashin green, freaks be yearnin
to be down, the Under Ground Kingz drinkin Crown with the Coke
Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby
(Hook - x2)
(Bun B)
It's the tough boy, boulevard niggas, rollin around tan up
All four corners on your block fool, nuttin but that bunny hop
happenin, high gassin, daily routine, my load is plush
Interior crush and fool I'm through clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
in your soul so letta player take control
And do what the hell ya been waitin
to see and that's me rollin on three Dayton's
Wit one of them thangs in the air, it's hangin up there
Shinin steel fat man, but I don't care if everybody sit back and stare
Everywhere we go they linin up as if we're startin up a parade
And everybody thinkin they get paid
But I don't really give a damn, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
on a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right
(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
Never let broke gold diggers ride
Never let broke gold diggers ride
"Got front and back, and side to side"
Never let broke gold diggers ride
"Got front and back, and side to side"

Never let broke gold diggers ride

<SONGSTART>Dear Lord, I know You don't condone
The things I be doin' out here in these streets
And I hope that, I pray that You can overlook
The wrong that I had done in my life
I don't know no other way to survive out here
I got a whole bunch of people dependin' on me
Just walk with me, walk with me
Busslin' and gamblin', hit licks scramblin'
Bricks, I'm out here handlin', I'm pimpin' and I'm payin' the rent
Didn't choose this dirty game, this dirty game, it chose me
Every city love cocaine, they'll get it from him
If they don't get it from me
So I get cross-country with that thang
Makin' that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin' that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
'Cause I put up sum from every sale so all my children can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell
But just put me in woodgrain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that sweet down 'cause that bullshit don't apply to me
'Cause out here on the real streets a dreamer always stay sleep
'Cause out here the strong survive
And now they didn't die from thankin' weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it hard, still tryna get right with God
Still read my Bible lone 'cause Reverend do wrong, still livin' fraud
Tonight if I get down on my knees
And ask the Lord to forgive me, please
You thank He gon' hear me?
'Cause tomorrow I'm still gon' be slangin' ki's
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
See, I was born in the ghetto, manye, I was raised in the hood
And unless you lived it yourself, it just can't be understood
People think hustlin' is cool or hustlin' is live
They don't understand hustlers only hustlin' to survive
They wished they lived in the 'burbs, wished they didn't have to hang
Out on corners in low-income house in projects and slang
They wish their daddy was home, mama wasn't on drugs
And they didn't have to grow up to be dealers and thugs
Po' children got aspirations and dreams just like the wealthy
But it's hard when that environment you live in ain't healthy
You ain't givin' no hope, nobody showin' you pride
And you live with all this anger and frustration inside
Dog, don't let nobody tell you what you can or you can't do
Just 'cause they funky ass couldn't do it, they ain't you
You can be who you wanna be, live life how you feel
Just put your faith in the Lord, now that's keepin' it trill fo' real
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's
For all the niggaz in the game that's been slangin' cheese
For all them boys on them swangers and their fifth wheel
I'm out here riskin' my life, niggaz shife but I stay trill
I pray so much, I wonder if the Lord love me
I think He do but I'm so caught up in my thug deep
The feds bug me, followin' me around for three
Niggaz couldn't catch me so they hit me with conspiracy
You know that that's the other level of the game
Ain't got shit on me but some niggaz said my name
So here they come, they thang tight
They playin' shife, no Bun, givin' me life
I ain't goin' back, I'm a make 'em kill me
I'ma bust back, fuck the pen, you feel me?
Wish I can hug my momma and kiss my baby girl
I know it's a better place than livin' in this dirty world
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Some people win and some people lose
Some always cryin' the blues, yeah
Some people win, some people lose
Some always bein' misused
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
'Cause I need You, Lord, right now
I need You, right now
Need Ya, I need Ya, I need Ya
I need Ya 'cause I'm goin' and livin' too fast, yeah
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Out here livin' too fast, how long can it last?
I can't get up, Lord, can You help me?
Lord, can You help me? Can You help me?
Can You help me, right now, yeah

Im campaignin for a new Benz
On the rims with bubble lenz
Im stackin' every dollar i see 100s 50s 20s and 10s
Doors open doors close never sweat hoes playas get yo's
Hustle and flow cars clothes thats the playa like that i know
Roll the dank up where the dro?
Pour the drank up where the fo's
Stackin money all on the low and we still ridin dirty
Got a drop top on them rollerskates
Candy jolly rancher paint
Enjoyin the spoils of hard work and grind more tryin to get bank
I dont know what them boys thinkin my motivation is benjamin franklin
Im tryin to maintain this wealth that i been calculatin
Gettin money thats all i know
On my toes never off my note
Woodgrain and hundred spokes i wave the trunk just like a pro
I grind its off to work i go I hustle hard its no stop
And if i flop i switch to hustle
I learned the game then set up shop
Im strivin' to make it to the top
Its all or nothin no turnin back
Im with them boys out on the block
Accumulating them paper stacks
Im makin money this where its at
Whatever it takes crack or jack
In love with my money and thats a fact
And we STILL RIDIN' DIRTY
Right now we got the 5th wheel reclinin
Trunk popped up screens fallin from the sky
Candy paint sprayed by eddie and im ridin on that glassy chrome
all courtesy of my hustle game
Real hustlin's in my blood line
I dont complain or whine
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make
a dime I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind but now i see that road to riches
Its a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs
I peep game from the best and since then i been playin chess
I put in work with no rest
To get that paper thats my quest
Im on the slow grind towards success
One of the best 'cause i keep it fresh
Im one hundred isnt nothin less
And im STILL RIDIN' DIRTY

<SONGSTART>Gawd-DAYUM! I don't know what y'all been thinkin bout
But I think this right here is about to shut dem damn haters down!
I'm from the streets that make niggaz walk slow talk low
With white chalk-o, mi casa be siete uno ocho
Brooklyn motherfucker, handle this - pardon my Spanish and French (Brooklyn baby!)
Okay, I stay clever like Mayweather with lay leather
'til your face sever, one of the greatest ever
Beyond ringing bells, my name's so demanding
Shit! - I got the swagger that'll leave Dakota "Fanning" (That boy still standing!)
I hope you niggaz over standing; I stay sucker-free
The next kaing of in the game, you ain't got enough to be
Your career last a week, that'll be luckily
Fuck with me, the rap game'll need protective custody
(AHH!) I'm the same thug to be, surrounded with women
Gave the game "True Religion" before you found it in denim
Feel the, "Wrath of Kane, " and you could not escape
The hip-hop version of "The Ring" and you just watched the tape (Next up!)
And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We Trill workin the wheel, understand nigga? (UNDERSTAND?)
I smother and split a bitch down to the tendon
High pressure, if you don't break your ass bendin
I'm way past endin in my series of warnin
You flex with me tonight playa you dead by the mornin (Woo!)
Bun Beater the best ever breathin or deceased
From the South to Midwest, Cali to the East
Got to any city nigga and bring my name up (all o'em!)
I bet I eat the best rapper they got in the game up
Call a nigga up, email him or chirp him
Make a meal out his motherfuckin ass and then burp him
(DAYUM!) Don't fuck around I'm not your lil' homey
I'm the king of the underground so act like you know me (Next up!)
Feel me...
Homie, we big steppin, big reppin
We givin kids Smith & Wesson's lessons, you get left with a sketchin
Left with the Midwest, clique Texans (who dat?)
G. and Daddy Kane, the click Texas, (word) pop you to death
I put private planes on swift Jetsons, niggaz know what it is
When you see the ball cap and a slick Thessons (woo!)
(Aight) Til you strip vexing to a movie clip from the Westerns
Shit from the Uzi clip lift up your midsection (Tell em G. Rap)
He will introduce you to the nose on the Glock fam
Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band (rock band!)
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man (AOOOW!)
High roller dose some hoes on the cock plan
Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin cheese til the rubberbands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em "Hot Pants" (Next up!)
I make your girl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt
I'm a young hot street flame (Flame)
They call me Sweet James, or call me Sir Jones
Two hundred dollar cologne
(Uh!) Board Nine, or Issey Miyaki
I got your girl mine, meat strong like saki
I ain't Rocky but I keep her rockin
Fuck around I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket
Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin watchin my top fall in
On my Lambourghini with the quick scream
Fettucini, linguini, shrimp and a bowl of lean!
What you know about gettin cross country
Nigga your piece big but your diamond look monkey
You need to take that shit back

Now, damn somebody need to beat Jacob's ass over that!

You kiss that thang and I'm out, cause she been playin with my pipe

Just to slide inside, man I done died tonight
Now what I'm 'sposed to do? Been got close to you
Lookin like a poster to, don't wanna boast but you Missus
Do a Dr. Feel good, lay a playa real good
Limpin came back, and it was still good, she will
Put a few tips in her mouth, that's that definition
Of them true chicks in the South, let me do my thang
On the cool quick to the crotch, get the beds but guess what?

And if I skip I'm back to D-slangin, keep them boys nod-headed
Keep the boppers with they butts swangin

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

<SONGSTART>Use me up, I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin' my mind
I'm trippin' and I know it 'cause I'm all nerved up
'Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin' my car
And everyday it get better, I can't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin' she ain't nothin' but a scrub
But she make me feel high like I'm hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I can't help myself, I know that I'm trippin'
But she got it goin' on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my credit card
You know she get it 'cause ya know that
(Chill, C)
I know, G, I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin' pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin' aw'll limp
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and still ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin' good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin' out them duckets and them, croka sacks
And everybody wonderin' why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, ask me why I wanna dis her
I told her 'cause her lovin' ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin' out and Byrd say I'm trippin' too
But this time I just can't listen to my whole crew
'Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But ninety two came around and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
To sum it all up, I'm breakin' all my rules
'Cause she got me droppin' off her little brother to school
I be gettin' bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on sex
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food
UGK sayin' peace out, and plenty of luck
And she could keep usin' Pimp C, uh, just a use me up
Ah, hah, well oh, baby, baby, baby
(Yeah, a just use me up)
Baby, ah, hah, well oh

Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch, holla at yo' bitch, now yo' bitch on my team
Got her buyin' us sticky green, lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch, you lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boyz, that's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today
Pro smoke, pro choke, anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take it, trick, I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya

Grippin' my steal, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
They tellin' me, "Bun, don't go there", but man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas but scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout or smokin' that joint 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain, and leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em from P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em, wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em to hell, to heaven
I just spent 60 G's on a brand new Eldo-reeze
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac, north star fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke when my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch 'cuz I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant, '84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed down Screw tapes that knock, blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks, try 20 ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas

Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play, it don't change, ain't a thang to say
It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go
Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers, body rockers
Late night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerrilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us
Touched like Midas, these bitch ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch ass niggas ain't got no cheese?
Blowin' big kill
(Blowin' big kill)
Million dollar deals

Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

Just shake your butts and bring back that stack (stack)
The mack is back and he's sittin on chrome
with a piece of chain or Herringbone or nugget (nugget)
That don't mean him a real live hoe
You ain't ready to roll then go on then, fuck it
Out them ducats, hoes better recognize
Niggaz better recollect, Bun finna regulate
I hit yo' town (what) find me a hoe stroll
Leave that bitch dry and head to another state (hold up)
Me and my brother can't wait when it come to the red
Cause we about that cash, cash
So if we can't convince ya we'll take your sister
Hit the highway and mash
You got, bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got, bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got, bitches that can and you got bitches that cain't
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch
Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care
I like the girl with the pussy hair
My partner Mike Mo like the pussy bare
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swang Big Dick, swang Sweet Jones
Go and get the myth out the cobra head
Girl got down you niggaz scared
I got a young yellow bitch, I'ma sing it loud
With a four-inch corner of jet-mink hair
Between her legs is where it great
And get the money out the nigga when she go on a date
I stay caked up, rocked up
Magnum rubbers stay socked up
I ain't tryin to get the wet dick
Hold my good but she ain't that slick
I know you want this high-dollar cum
Bitch know I got money, wanna get her some
Bitch you must, done lost your mind
The trick's niggaz over there, you better get on the grind
Bitches not flexin ain't much good
I should and I would keep clear if I could
But when I do I just CAWN'T get away
Cause I gotta fuck all day every day
That leaves me run loco for real
All these chickenheads lie about deal
Ain't gotta do it up to make me chill
Find a good spot on the floor and kneel!
Know that my heart's in between my fires
Though I can't take when they look in my eyes
Lookin for love that's no surprise
Comin up off, that's family ties
Then I hit it from the back, all the way
Slap that back and just lock cross say
Not freeze out without no delay
Girls in the chat, I ain't got shit to say

And bend they pussy over, for my nigga, and touch they toes

Steady breakin' niggas on them shiny ass thangs

If you fittin' ta ride foreign, then, nigga, you gotta chop
And Southern niggas still got the nerve to ride D's
I ain't hatin' on Daytons, but it's 2000, nigga please
It's all about the candy paint, it's all about the Vogues
It's all about the slab, baby, it's all about the hoes
Got some cars and some pros some real and some fraud
Hated on by a nigga, hated on by a broad

And that nigga that you live with ain't like me
Ain't from Atlanta but I know these hoes like me
They pulling on my zipper wanna bite me
I got a bitch from Oakland like to get hyphe
In the bed with her head in a jib
Eating on my dick like it's some corn or a barbeque rib

Shake it slow, to and fro, back and forth, up and down

Real stuck on that backside, it's looking kind of right
With the juicy tank top and a loop of ten heels
All bullshit aside, she looking ready to kill
But when I say kill, I mean murder the cock
I'm talking beating the pussy up while the headboards knock
She ain't watching the clock, ain't finna answer the phone

Put your feet in the sky, bring your knees to your chest
Grab a hold to the sheets, bitch, and I'ma do the rest
Get to pressing on your pink, gripping on your soft
To the side, take a ride, from the back I break you off
I want some pussy and some navel and some ass and some mouth
I ain't fucking for me bitch, I'm fucking for the whole south

Feel like they're starting fires

Sometimes I start my own, most lies do hurt me
Coming down like a homicide victim,
Just cause I look and sound different
Comin down like James Bond, I'm on another
Mission 005.7 like the rate of homicide victims
Violent crimes are hard to retire, they never Will
I am fucking legend even if I am killed

Be in high school was a jock

Player, a professional wrestler
Similar to Brock Lesnar
Even a ladies man, a bodybuilder
Once again a boxer, a skilled dribbler
A debater, snowboarder
A triathlete, a break dancer
Now I hate dancing, a wake boarder
Even a cheerleader, more like
A peer mediator, Who am I
Where's my first breath
Took profound leaps in every step,
I was even into football, ob course
Basketball, bring it soccer, even tennis
Can't stop winning, it's addictive

<SONGSTART>So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F**k it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C:)
Sweet jones
My bitch a choosey lover, never f**k without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like the f**k for 40 dollars in the club
f**king up the game, bitch you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Bun B:)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B U N B
Cause what's a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoes?
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get jones
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi:)
Eni mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-saw pole
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b**** is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, walk it off from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
I, I choose you baby

Well, I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm smoking big fat dank
I don't fuck around no mo with that goddamn drank
But every time I get down with my nigga Big Mike
We go and get a bottle of that Dom all night
I got that green monster baby, can you buy that?
Plus I got Swisha suit for days, you wanna try that?
I roll them, most of them big and fat they look like ball bats
I live in P A T, the East side, niggas sayin' jack
These laws be trippin' 'cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it in cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living a Mac
And I ain't trippin', flippin' then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
'Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees
Full of Dom Perignon, Amp water for the G's
It's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes
It just be like that sometimes, it just be like that sometimes

Got boppers that's steady jockin, goofy niggaz in my ear
Bitch I'ma self-made trillionaire, get your soft ass outta here
Weak niggaz wanna plead their case (case), just to raise up out my face (face)
I ain't got that time to waste, punch your mouth and knock out the taste
You MySpacin and Facebookin, playin games with them toys
I'm in the streets where gangstas meet, while you're online with them boys
So step your game up, build your name up, quit your talkin and quit your doin
All that planning and contemplating. when the f**k you gon' start pursuing?
Cars ain't driving themselves, mansions ain't building themselves
They waiting for Annie Mae and they need to stop feelin themselves
They wealth ain't comin until they earn it
But that somethin they won't know 'til they learn it, while burnin...
(Pimp C)

<SONGSTART>Uhhhhhhhh ~!
If you know like I know you would get down on the flo'
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisha full of 'dro
We can get down for my dime and we can f**k, on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha f**kin with me fo'?
Every lady ain't a hoe and every hoe ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't f**k around with no punks
Ride with me she holdin a pistol while I'm whippin and poppin the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems 'long as she hear what the f**k I said
Pimpin ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here livin by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm lookin at you you choosin me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm superstar, we headed to the top
(Chorus: sung)
I'm stayin true, I'm out here whippin my Mercedes
F**kin with the midnight ladies - the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm bangin Screwwww, my young girl lookin fine
We stayin out here on the grind - and keepin money on our mi-ii-iind
(Bun B:)
Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, gotta feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster-ass persona so hard it can dent, steel
In the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leakin fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust

Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leakin out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you gotta go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Gotta pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Gotta play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's yo' turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a f**k how you feel
(Chorus)
(Pimp C:)
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the SOOOOOOOOOUTH
This scary hoe don't wanna know what it's ABOOOOOOOOUT
Cause I stay country true down to the co', dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws, feel it tighten up don't stop don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars, f**k the D.A. f**k the law
I f**k the snow but I love a pro like flatbackers I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer, drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker, bitch around me man I'ma mack her
(Bun B:)
From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of 'dro and Impala bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki', and ten kilos grams in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's one point five mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is tickin, time is pressin
No second guessin, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK
(Chorus)
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S H O R T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be living naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell
I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fucking maker
'Cause I ain't taking, no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts
Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch
This dope ain't yo dope and these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafucking guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafucking road
And don't even try to come back nigga, yo
'Cause me Dre and C got fingers on a fat trigger
We making too much money moving weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper booming cold blow yo ass up
And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailing on yo bitch ass
But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas
Niggaz on the track dropping shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cooking up some llello for the local drug king
The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slanging some more white dust
Real, oh, so trill, the life's no glamor
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fucking up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home
And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales
Stupid muthafuckas smoking dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fighting Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops finding my stash, yo what could the worst be
Through so going undercover then turning dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Calling my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas
I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't 'bout to sell no fucking dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope but you still ain't selling shit
Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon' let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafucking cuts
So step in like I said before, we'll take them muthafucking nuts
Ask the last nigga brought his fucking ass down
Trying to sell that fucking dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'm a go to Port Arthur and run them fucking niggaz
Brought his fucking gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac
Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope
Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
'Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafucking killas
So have your shit attached, before you come check us
Pimp C, bitch, P.A. home, Short Texas

Made up the word, that's why I'm so trill
Now everybody, wanna bite my swagger
Roll like a stone, like my name Mick Jagger
Say it befo', had to tell you hoes again
Run a drum machine, like my name Roger Men
Write the rhyme do the beat, the hook and the mix

UHH...
Dedicated to all the underdogs, knahmtalkinbout?
Muthafuckas told me I wasn't gon be shit...
Told me I was gon be able to do this rap shit...
Knahmtalkinbout? My own family talked down on me, knahmsayin?
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (My uncle told me I wasn't gon be shit)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (I used to walk around with a bag full of rappers)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
(Motherfucker told me, a nigga from Texas couldn't make no record)
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
(Then after I made the record, muh'fuckers said they would never give us no respect)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... (But now they tryna rap like us)
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah... (Tryna be like us, tryna smell like us)
(Knahmtalkinbout?)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money... (Check this out)
[Pimp C:]
Man I refuse to let the bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up, but they cain't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a hoe open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a hoe for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
(right... right...)
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (hmm...)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (hmm...)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho...
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money...
[Pimp C:]
To all the babies havin babies on ya' own
I know you feelin fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, "Ya fucked up your life"
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy with lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggaz tellin you, "Ya crazy"
"What you thankin? You too young to have a family"
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggaz ain't gon ride witchu
But get down with that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin
It's time to change sumthin...
[Chorus]
[Pimp C:]
If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, "It ain't enough room in the NBA"
You tell them haters, "Save that bullshit for another day"
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, "You ain't gon make it", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase to hog it up, the lawyer end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be shame and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right...
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
... (Uh!)

It's been a long time since I busted on a glock

Marooned up and dropped, like my Biarritz on top

Lay down the competition, take their cash crops and get my push on
Moved up to Bentley with more chrome from a Lexus key
All because we cornered the market on that Texas tee
And we don't bar no plexes, we way bigger than other men though
The diamond deuces on tinted windows, we in the wind yo
We 'Chevro way' the wind blow, that's the corner we been Joe
Don't know where you been bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though
When it's ten fo', good, but in my Styrofoam good and muddy

We grippin' that woodler, bud it, sit back and scope it
Pay attention to Prince and pushin' everything about to pump it

I just parked it in the grass and brought some brand new shit
A Phantom Rolls Royce, 24's with the bump
I ain't trippin' about the seat, I got them woofers in my trunk
Cut in my swisher, codeine on my whiskers
Fuckin' with that Smoke D, Bundy and that Vicious
UGK Records, it's an institution
Know a lot of niggaz livin' off of prostitution
Pimpin' ain't dead, it just moved to the web
Bitch ain't gotta hit the track, ain't gotta give no tricks no head
Ain't got to give no tricks, no pussy, just cameras and screams
Easiest money you can get, it's the American Dream bitch
Man I'm a middle finger figure, a million dollar mission
Poppin' like Orville Redenbacher, with a whippin' in the kitchen
Yayo like Dontrelle Willis, we the trillest on the mound
I'm holdin' that whole South down, I know you feel us
We the realest walkin' the planet
Can't stand it, pass away, wanna fight us
Start to swingin', wanna kill us, blast away, wanna stab us
Get to stickin but make sure you cut us deep
'Cause I betcha we comin' back a couple hundred brothers deep
Pimp and Bun, we run the streets, which streets? Man, pick your hood
Don't matter, we represented, cross us? We gon' get you good
Them Down South veterans, ain't nobody better than
Gonna tell your next of kin or your brethren, let us in cousin

Lookin good spendin some nigga G's
Nails by Vietnamese, [unverified], lookin' like they worth G's
Dress above they knees, jellies and G-strings up the ass
Man I never let 'em pass
So, tell me where can I find 'em
With they nigga or in that candy Cadillac right behind him
Bitches tellin' me see yo' dick grand
All she wanna do is ride Su-bur-ban
Put her ass on the leather and rub the wood
See we got boppers in Texas oh, man that pussy look good
So, I let them hoes ride and I show them a grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
When she told me I looked good I didn't feel no pride
All the bitch wanted to do is just fuck my ride
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car

Niggaz talkin' 'bout, how they passin' these hoes 'round
But y'all trickin', them hoes told me

Fifty dollars there, a hundred dollars here
You brought the bitch a drink and all her homegirls a beer
Your homeboys lookin for ya, but yo' ass gone
You left your niggaz at the club and took all them hoes home
And didn't even fuck, man what the fuck
If you didn't want to fuck then get the fuck up out the truck
You know what I mean? I ain't showin out Vogues
Just so these hoes can be seen, c'mon you wanna fuck or cut?
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
When you look at my chrome and you lick your lips
It's just like I'm rubbin' my dick between your hips
And when you smile and shake your ass, my grill smile right back
Bitch I'm the real, that's why I ride Cadillac
And I'ma fuck you and fuck all yo' friends
Soon as Pimp C come through in that 600 Benz
With burgundy paint, butter and LG rims
Color TV, VCR playin X-rated films
Of myself, runnin up in beauty queens
But let me tell y'all niggaz the difference between y'all and me
You see, man I can tell all that bitch wanted to do
Is just ride for free and smoke for free
But bitch not me, you better ask them hoes if my name Pimp C
Unless your pussy makin ten thousand dollars a week
The only way I see you sittin in my passenger seat, you bitch!

the highway was so wet, i'm slippin' out my lane
the bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
i bet you never seen a big truck like that
i bet you never got a dick sucked like that
the bitch didn't know that i was tapin' the whole scene
now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen
the glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
i got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
tryin' to close me down, but i got ghetto love
i'm pimp c bitch, i'm comin' down richer than rich
so bitch you know you gotta gimme good stuff
Chorus:

blowin' swisher sweet smoke
Verse 2 (bun-b):
We flippin' worldwide, p.a.t. international jetsetters
bigger than the hollywood letters
but don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
breakin' off the jealous with pitch black barettas
my fellas and tellers who holdin' plates against them texas boys
bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex
like you major boy you have done played yourself

a one-way ticket to something bigger than you
over your head and got scared
exactly what i figured you'd do
now who you kiddin', i'm slangin', bangin', and skiddin'
busta playa moves and if you done it and did it
as i sit in the lap of luxury
dea is tryin' to stick bugs to me
undercover motherfucker tried to sell drugs to me

mafioso puttin' bombs under my load
never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
now i'm comin' down shinin'
pieces and chains full of diamonds
i'm winin' and dinin' and caligula
pretty boys gettin' off the hook

Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin-swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
[Pimp C:]
When the top starts fallin the bitches start callin
My trunk start bangin and the fo's start crawlin
The drank mixed up, in the cream soda bottle
Her lips, hit my dick that's why I smashed on the throttle
Swisha Sweet candy, Robert Davis in my cup
I'm swervin like Bootsy but I couldn't give a fuck (fuck)
You see this car? (You see this car?)
You see this truck? (You see this truck?)
They both for me now watch them girls get buck (buck)
Ain't shit friendly but we still have fun (fun)
UGK for life, you know the Pimp and the Bun (Bun)
The great state of Texas, candy in the Lexus
Dick for them hoes jaws, pistols for the flexers
Somebody asked me why I'm ridin on the East
All I did was told the truth, the bullshit niggaz cease (cease)
If you ain't hatin nigga why the fuck you mad?
If your records ain't sellin, get your fingers out ya ass, bitch!
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Well it's the king of the trill (trill) wood wheel in my palm (palm)
Yeah I'm sittin sideways on suedes smokin that bomb (bomb)
The granddaddy kush mixed with a little O.G. (fo' sho')
That's my breakfast, off top I gotta blow three
Not to mention codeine, liquid and the pill (pill)
Bloats on my grill with my hand on my steel (steel)
Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing
I'ma gon' and pop the trunk, surely but slowly
Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your Colby Jet system (no)
Your slab ain't holdin, ain't no use to you frontin
And I'm fin' to shut the game down when I push the button
And the... [echoes]
[Chorus]
[Cory Mo:]
Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang
Cory Mo about to do the damn thaaaaang
In the butter guts with the diamond in the back
King Kongs in the trunk, hit the switch and watch it crack
I'ma let my paper stack and quote nothin but facts
So don't "ax" me nothin partner 'less you droppin some cash (cash)
Now she hoppin it fast (fast) that's just how I like it (like it)
Turn around and show me somethin girl I'm gettin excited (oooh)
Ain't nobody trippin cause the money already made
I done said it befo', so I'ma say it again
And let my top drop dowwwwwn
[Chorus]

<SONGSTART>It all started with a Pimp C, bitch
So what the fuck is up?

From the trill villa wit a steel trigga land of the real killers
Pop pop muthafucka there you go
I'ma bust 'em on yo ass if you don't ease up off me ho
'Cause trill niggas don't carry no sugar in they nutsac
Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack
So you gon' give me my money but you don't hear me though
But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes
P.A. nigga, trill ass nigga
How you figga you can buck me down nigga?
Mr. big an, Mr. big time, give me what's mine
Instead of buying cars for a bitch named sunshine
Give me what's mine, give me what's mine
Before it come down to triggas
Shit, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Bitch, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Uh, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
But you can't hear me
It's the return of the trill ass niggas bitch
Yea muthfuckas, I figured you run
I figured you run, when I pull triggas to guns
That triggas to guns P.A. fool a nigga named Bun
A nigga named Bun, no more sun, no more shine
Say hello to the nine milly millameter
(Buck, buck, buck)
Money tight glock, bustin' them shots
When I break yo ass off somethin' hot
Niggas steady catchin' lead to the head
I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin' bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin', niggas start passin' away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise, I'm gettin' Chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now it's the return of the trill ass niggas

Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches

And wanna be gangsters that's scared to put 'em in ditches
Fed's takin' pictures so the cameras go click
And video rollin' while I'm holdin' my dick
They follow me around like they doin' they job
But while you watchin' me how many people gettin' robbed
Lets keep it trill 'cause we already know

Before we get started, every body roll up one for Pimp C
Before we go any further, take your lighter, light it up for me
Now let's go, now let's go and all the girls get down on the floor

Take his all money to the mall and buy the sto' up
Never a flaw when she show up
These other broads hatin on her, if they sick they need to throw up
She got class and panache with precision
Picture perfect in my vision and I done made a decision
That I'm tired of wishin, get down with the Bun and Pimp and
You could roll with the playas on the million dollar mission, c'mon
Uhh, hey mama, I'm a tell you what the deal is
I like your style, I like how you handle your business
You ain't out here trippin chasin boys in showbiz
You're confident, you out here puttin it down for yo' kids
I don't care 'bout no nigga, he don't concern me
He ain't teachin you nothin, you need to learn me
Check out my mind, I'm 24 on the grind
I got the key to the streets, I got a open line
And I don't get caught up in "he say, she say"
And I don't chase the cat, I keep the P play
I wouldn't holla if I ain't thought you was ready boo
I know you feelin me, cause girl I'm feelin you
Ooh baby (ooh baby)
Ooh baby (oh baby)
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up now
Yeah she a bad mamma-jamma, a brick, house
Still I fits, out, cause she thick, stout
With the feminine fat, in all the right places
She look me in my eyes and she make all the right faces
Cause she's a real catch, we make a tough pair
A true dynamic duo and we up there
We sittin tall at the top
And if she ride or die for me playa I'm a give her all that I got
I break her off and not, let her hold the keys
I don't take her out of town, man I take her oas
It ain't trickin if you spend it on your lady
Bring the bacon home to baby and everything'll be gravy
Just let me know if that's soundin like a plan
Cause all you really need to change your life is the man
And you appealin to the King of the Trill and
I just wanna know if you're feelin me like I'm feelin, you
Ooh baby (ooh baby)
Ooh baby (oh baby)
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up now

[Bun B]
A bad day for the niggaz in my click
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It's seems the drug situation is so tow up
And poes down the fuckin T-X had to show up
I got shit on the scene so 99 can't hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret and there's no rest
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
In Dynasties.I-ROCs... and Caravans and muthafuckas are swolen
Like paper stacks and a rubberband
Goin all out of tact on the local bird slaggin brothaman
And be servin as slow as fuck
Cause my niggaz are nervous
and if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggaz is happy with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town
Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my tags off my buick and yall know I didn't love that
Rollin on some white balls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, YOU GOTS TO DO YOUR OWN NAILS!
I told my niggaz to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town
God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back up!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my click
Got the birds, and reopen my lab back up
And told my boys, "If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye,
Don't give him a chance to identify!"
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at random, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Close to the dopeman - God damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
CAUSE IN MY YARD IS A BIG ASS - I GOT YALE SIGN!
It's time for TONY MONTANA stacks
I got niggaz on the corner holdin big ass bags and cans of crack
The land of Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fools run in with your glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last love
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight lights
when the feds in town
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

Comin' down on the slab, boy
Ridin' dirty, for real tho, ridin' dirty
Have you ever been rollin' in a clean ass 'Lac
Blowin' big out the window, everybody got a sack
Got my heat right between my seat, got a box of them thangs
In case these fools start playin' with me
You'd be surprised how them boppers wink, girl, I can't stop
Give my headlights a blink and roll them up out the top
And keep movin' and keep rollin'
Fools that don't be holdin' I'm comin' through and foldin'
And I can't stand snitches, wanna kill all of y'all
Even though some bustas fall I'm still rollin' like a ball
And having things my way, hittin' that highway
Sellin' that big yay, a plush-ass place to stay
Police, they wanna run in
Talkin' on cell phones got a lotta kids done in
I wanna live like Arnold, Willis and Mr. Drummond
And keep my paper sturdy, big birds and tight herbs
Fool, I'm ridin' dirty
Big birds and tight herbs, fool I'm ridin' dirty
Ridin' dirty, fool, ridin' dirty
Tell me can you feel it? Man, nothin' can save ya
I believe it's that season for gettin' yo papers
Or haven't you heard about them birds? We call it that cheese
In Texas we get it with ease, hit I-10 if you please
But these polices, they think they sharp as creases
For no reasons, man, they straight up strippin' cars to pieces
Out of suspicion or if they thinkin' you on a mission
Ain't no wishin' or prayin', they sayin' assume the position
Hands behind ya head, down on ya knees
You get the case and they get yo weight and yo G's
Come on, I use to ride the Port Arthur city streets
With a chick with pretty feets and a box of Philly Sweets
They tried to finish me but couldn't get it done
So somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty
Man, somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty

One with a trigger, two with a bat
Three big brothers, fo' - wanna squab with me
So I guess a brother gotta throw
Tell 'em like this, ya better get up out my camp dude
Befo' I have to pull my gat and get, real rude
I don't figure that it's worth gettin hurt
Just 'cause ya gal wanna give me that skirt
Bet it feels funny when ya doin 69
Knowin that ya sippin on all my jimmy wine
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bad
Knowin that ya swallowed all the skeeter that I had?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda shot you up instead I told ya somethin good
[Chorus: sampled from Chaka Khan & Rufus' "Something Good"]
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah... yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
[Bun B:]
Aiyyo, what's up with that bulge in ya khakis?
You wanna pack a gat, but you STILL ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gangload of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cause by yourself, you're runnin to the flo'
I seen your kind befo', man ya nothin with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin when ya chillin with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin up some daisies
See crazy you wanna be, but punks with no heart, they ain't hard
They just waitin for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep your weak self locked in ya hood
Cause without your boys I'm a have to tell ya somethin good
[Chorus]
(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)
[Pimp C:]
Brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check ya girl and what she did in the past
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her REAL fast
But I don't trust the dugout, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check ya blood and let somebody check your teeth
But if you don't step, I'm a drop on ya fast
And pump off bullets like government cash
I didn't do ya girl but your sister was alright
Took her to my homeboy's Caddy last night [girl moaning in the background]
She waxed my jimmy, and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit if from the back, and the girl just THREW ME
Told me, "Pump it harder, " and she scratched me on my BOOTY
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty lil' girl
[Chorus 1/2]
[Bun B:]
Let's talk about these half-n-half punks
By day they sorry bastards, at night they talkin bout, poppin trunks
Butter .25 cain't keep you alive
From a sawed-off, fool so I hope you survive
See bluffin might save ya tail one day
But who's ta say, it won't catch ya next week, on the runway?
You might shoot a few shots in the wind
But the same time tomorrow, you'll be runnin again
Now can you keep it up, every damn night?
You steady runnin to the argument but runnin from the fight
What's the deal man? Why don't you take your Raiders cap off?
Cause one of these days, you gonna getcha head slapped off
You cain't keep a crew cause they gettin sick of seein you bail
Like a punk'll hit the backstreet trail
And the women don't like you cause ya act like them
And that's why your little jimmy never went fo' a swim
Ya talk about slangin, makin G's
But I saw a fiend chase ya from, BJ's up to Mickey D's
Now everyday punks get took
Either for they dough, they'll ride 'em for the powder that they cook
You bookin from the scene cause ya couldn't hold ya own
A 40 ounce bottle slams, ya dead to your dome
Now you want revenge, so ya get your automatic
Find a group of hard-heads, and startin kickin static
Ya pulled ya little chrome but these fools got gats
Try to run and caught two buckshots in ya back
Now you nothin but a memory that's gone in a slayin
So when I tell you somethin good, punk I don't be playin

Be there four deep... hella clan

Best believe Kool Ace gon' keep it real.

Pimpin' ain't no illusion...

Pimpin' ain't dead... nigga, it just began

My hoes still out there sellin' ass.
Yo' bitch is out of pocket,
'Cause yo' pimpin' was scary;
Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy.
Fuck niggas watch them mack and pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what y'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'.
This is the conclusion: pimpin' ain't no illusion.
[Chorus: x2]
Bun B:
If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her,
'Cause a beggar ain't a muthafuckin' chooser.
Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean.
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a wif a this...
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior... and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny... sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again... that's why...
[Chorus: x2]
Too $hort:
You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money... it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game.
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it.
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin'...beeyatch.

<SONGSTART>So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part."
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it"
"Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets"
"Had to tie her to a rocket"
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up"
"Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up"
"(Shit)"

Niggas ain't real, must'a started smokin' rocks

Keepin' me a pro, next to my fo'
Instead of stackin' cheese

Fuck ass nigga, fuck ass nigga

Nigga, everybody rappin' like they ballin' and they rich

They diamonds ain't shinin' and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm grippin' on the grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm workin' wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville, your step daddy can get killed
If he keeps talkin' shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you tryin' to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the South
For them niggas and them girls with them golds in they mouth
The boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill, bitch you ain't what this about, about
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit

We ain't got nothin' to gain but I got everythin' to lose
So I'm forever bring the blues to the issue
Pick and choose if I miss ya, stick and move when I diss ya
Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, it was made for me to gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my
Flow fly, dope my, wait awhile you know why? Why?
Too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars, baby ballin'
Bullshitter, frontin' like rottweiliers, no bark, no bite
But showin' thangs, talkin' loud like they knowin' thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane, your ass mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight, it ain't no passin' tonight

Waitin' for me to fall but yet they comin' off the wall
Till I'm ready, keep the gun steady and ready
For anybody crossin' the line with get that fuck shit

Got the radio on pump when I come through a slump

With a rusty ass niner lookin' for trouble

It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital
Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that
There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?"
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution

And I'm bringing this paper faster than
These other lil bastards can
So I'm digging in my mind for the bitches I broke
And keep a player paid in full cause pimping ain't no joke
You want to pop that pussy that's a slim ass chance
Put the paper in the panties when you get that dance
This C.O.D. nigga, so you can keep your nuh plastic cards
No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers
But why slap us when you think a nigga down on his luck
You try and flag us when you see us coming down in a buck
Now what the fuck part of the game taught y'all that bitch play
See we makes a bitch pay
Like a bitch weigh
And then a bitch stay
Wouldn't sit still
Fuck how this shit feel
This ain't studio pimping
This shit real pimping
I got them bitches popping pussy getting buck (getting buck)
And you know that we couldn't give a fuck (give a fuck)

And the game that we go don't stop (don't stop)

And you know that we always blowing herb (blowing herb)
And in the club man you know we stay strapped (stay strapped)
And bitch you know that it ain't about this rap (ain't about this rap)
To many niggaz out here buying hoes a meal
Nigga that ain't the way a bitch supposed to feel
I close the deal from the front door
Fuck me right and suck me tight
And you just might hit the blunt hoe
I don't stunt and blow smoke up your ass baby
But don't be acting all saditty with class baby
You with a nigga such as my self it'll cost you
So pay before a nigga fuck around and be the tosser
Sweet Jones, gripping grain
With all that shit you talk ain't got no bezatine chain
And most of y'all niggaz ain't nothing but tricks
But we sipping lean and breaking bricks
Popping pills, work the wood wheel
Fuck where you're from and fuck how you feel
If you want to go to war I'll take you to war

I got them bitches popping pussy getting buck (getting buck)
And you know that we couldn't give a fuck (give a fuck)

Niggaz wanna do my dirt
Balling down on Beale Street
Sipping on a pint of syrup
Chopping up the chronic weed
Picking all the fucking seeds
Trying to slow my roll
In my trunk I got them fucking keys
Always riding Chevy things
Shining on them twanky things
Kids I'm a role model
Police I'm a dope man
Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead
Never has it left my mouth
Optimos a fifth of crown
Red eyes with a frown
Niggaz with them gold teeth
Fast talking on the town
Some of us are under cover

Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash
I'mma go pimp a bitch

Always got to watch your friends
Backstabbers cause a snitch
Now see let me blow your mind the real business in the wind
The main thing fucking up these hoes is their fucking friends
You remember back in day it was niggaz pimping hoes
Take a look around now it be hoes pimping hoes
What the business what the deal man these hoes got me fucked

I ain't mad about my girl licking pussy with a girl
Cause she got to get it done but that thing ain't my world

Pussy nigga, I pack that nine everytime and I ain't trying dying
I just wanna celebrate
Cause trill niggaz don't die
Pussy nigga, thinking you gon kill me
I got some'ing for your ass, nigga you gon feel me
I'ma blow you out the water, with the 2-23
Putting dick up in your daughter, rap is over I serve some cheese
Nigga talking bout, robbing Chad
Run up on me with that first, will leave you stinking in the grass
If your calico to mask, if you Baptist go to church
See a hoe up in a nigga, gon pull up a skirt
That'll be, some incredible shit
Niggaz scheming on my bezel, on some devilish shit
I been to hell and back, on another level you bitch
Go on try it I'm going live, they gon need a shovel for you bitch
I been stabbed I been shot, went from no fans to being hot
But somehow always fall short, for trying to keep fiddles in my pot
In a dog eat dog world, y'all fellas be chasing girls
When I place myself in history, too hot for a ladder to catch me
But I can't help but to notice, I'm one of the coldest
And I know y'all haters love when I'm locked up, but I won't lose focus
Yeah I wrote this counting down, how many days I got
So lately my gun ain't been hid, it's been displayed a lot
My attitude is fucked up, I don't give a fuck cause I just don't give one
Thinking bout living a life where everything you do right is wrong, mo'fucker I live one
I know niggaz wanna kill me, but I'm still riding pride
Cause the Lord riding with me, and that's the main reason why
Some niggaz win, and some niggaz lose
Some niggaz getting bruised, some always crying to blues
Some niggaz already lost, and ain't gon lose no mo'
Big shoes hoe choose, ain't paying dues no mo'
Everything y'all trying to do, I built a school hoe
Now it's fly to talk country, I made the rules hoe
I was sagging in my khaki's, 'fore Dickies cool
Gangsta Nike's on my feet, our music banging in the streets
The young B.G.'s, really love to thump
Fuck radio and BET, I'm out here bumping in the trunk
For the girls popping pussy, and the boys with the blow
Cadillac'ers and flat-backers, I'm out here repping for it hoe
Can't any man, boy or woman take away my soul
It's a gift given from God, and I'm keeping a tight hold
The world is ugly and cold, trying to make me the same
But I'ma keep it one hundred, when it come to the game
Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up
We keep it click tight, so when niggaz start lurking
In the dark heaters start, anybody start jerking
Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg
A dragging society, don't borrow don't beg
For tomorrow so gon 'head with your pity, I'ma be cool
Kindergardeners was looking up to me, in pre-school
Down with Pimp C fool, and P-A-T the town
Representing it to the fullest, till I'm gone I hold it down
Bun Beater, would never sell you no lie
So if you ask for the truth, I'ma reply to trill niggaz don't die

<SONGSTART>(cocaine cocaine), I'd like to introduce you all to
(cocaine cocaine) UGK, UGK bitch my man Bun B
Pimp C in the house y'all, put your hands together
Big Dick Cheney and Snowy Snow, (cocaine cocaine)
(Pimp C:)
Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggaz, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'ma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose
Cocaine, cocaine
(Bun B:)
They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Columbia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine
(Rick Ross:)
You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
And my yayo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

Opposite of well, can't anticipate me

If you're not sick, as far or rhyming
Or studying to go to College

The trunk poppa, ready to break y'all off somethin' proper
You know I'm a villain so why try?
Fuck a glock, I'm throwin' a glock party, darin' niggas to drive by
I came to smoke a son of a bitch that went for his but didn't pull it
Fast enough and got blasted up with a bullet
I'm snipin', I got you in my scope so what's the use of tryin' to bail?
I'm ready to catch a case but not for yayo, for a murder, mayne
187 ways to rip ya spine out anytime you wanna test
Say you never heard of pain? Wait till I pull my nine out
And empty out a clip in yo chest cavity
Haven't we been known for takin' it
To the sucka muthafuckas that was fakin' it
Makin' it known I gots my chrome in my ride
And I'm fried, PA nigga worldwide from the Westside, fool
Yeah, I'm serious and this is one of three sixteens
Yeah, ya bastards, I'm serious, this is only one of three sixteens
Straight up, I'm serious that was only one of three sixteens
Now check this shit out
It's DJ DMD, back with that funk flowin' lazy
Kinda crazy, never letting niggas fade me, I'm a little fast on the trigga
Niggas, I get my blast on nightly, you don't wanna fight me
Take yo ass on down the block, I keeps my shit cocked
So knock on wood 'cuz shit could get hot
On this spot, some niggas catchin' lead shots
'Cuz ain't no wipin' off these red dots
Now try me if you think I won't bust
Shots to ya dome will leave ya ass in the dust, nigga
'Cuz ain't nobody droppin' bigger hits
I'm makin' tracks upon, track upon, tracks to make these niggas shit
And I'm down with some fa sho, niggas
So tell me how you gon' diss me with a clique full of ho niggas?
You keep yo ass in yo muthafuckin' set
Or take a slug in ya muthafuckin' chest, Reggie
Mark ass nigga, ya punk bitch
I'm serious and this is two of three sixteens
Ya punks, I'm serious, this is two of three sixteens
Punk ass niggas, I'm serious, this was two of three sixteens
Sixteen number three
Some muthafuckas think they can go with me
But most of them niggas just some hoes to me
I got a lotta niggas that's down with me
But too many niggas like to clown with me
They act like they know me but they really don't
They ask me to come kick it but they know I won't
I see they ass in PA, they don't know me
I see they ass in Houston, I'm they homie
But nigga, how it feel to be a ho?
Gettin' yo ass kicked at every muthafuckin' show
Tryin' to be a gangsta but nigga you's a fool
And tryin' to kick it with me, like me and y'all cool
But nigga, let's see if you can with that chrome
I shoulda popped yo ass when you rolled into my home
But bitch niggas steal and G niggas mack
And busta ass niggas gettin' bullets in they back
And that's a muthafuckin' fact
Ya little muthafucka, I'm serious
And that was three of three sixteens
For any niggas that wanna test

I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F*** it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that b**** do you dirty
we'll wipe her a** out and send detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C)
Sweet jones
My b**** a choosey lover, never f*** without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for 40 dollars in the club
f***** up the game, b**** you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them b****es too scary
Your b**** chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Bun B)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
Because its greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
Im a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar b****
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C & B U N B
Cause whats a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoe
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose
OOOooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi)
Eeny mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl dont touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the C-Support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers couldn't stop the
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last pump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooooohhhhh Ooooooohhh
I chose you girl
IIIIiiii
I chose you baby

A long, long way, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, well, I know, I know, I know, yeah
Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin' crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper I gotta do it quick
Thinkin' I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin' wit, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live everyday like it's my muthafuckin' last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'ma die
But if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'ma take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say, "It'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
This world we livin' in man it ain't nuthin' but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya in New York niggas gettin' shot fo bombers
Now they got yo life in the former they in like California
Niggas wit dubs are hydroponic, marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pops died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wished it was twice mayn
I remember bein' eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not givin' a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' to the end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen fo damn near ten
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day you here but the next day you gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
I'm up early 'cuz ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets Peanut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin' shife, so shife back
Can't show no weakness wit these bitches life jacked
Mayn it's a trip where I stay especially for me
Them bitches tryin' to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga down in Florida Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I ain't no liar
My man BoBo jus' lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God why he let these killas live
And take my homeboy's son away
Man if you got kids show 'em you love 'em
'Cuz God jus might call 'em home
'Cuz one day you're here, the next day you're gone
I know, you know, well, well, yeah
La ra la ra, I know, yeah, yeah

<SONGSTART>I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pimpin' down the ave you know I'm lookin' tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that
Who's says he's going through a thang
When ya'll ain't never lied
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
When I hurt and try to hate 'cause she knows the thrill is gone
Say man, I stop smokin' with haters back in ninety four
But niggas thinkin' that a sweeps gone get the through my door
And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye to eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight
And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this away
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away
My dead homey momma's tear shit
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 503
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets just keep on gettin' live with me
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin' that
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains
It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to ESG and all the victims of the game
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I'm pimpin' through the ave. tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown, when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuck 'n' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
So it's your life

<SONGSTART>Hi life
We livin' that hi life
Hi life
We livin' that hi life
I'm tired livin' f**ked up, tired of livin' bad
Tired of grandmama telling me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm tryin to live up to the image
That she would want me to be
But I got one foot in the street and every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G but Niggas depend on me
It ain't fake to hit a 10 so niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushing cocaine niggas holding pistols
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20, 000 tryin' to turn it into a hundred, and ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas came to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch thinking she can ease my mind by suckin' my dick
Bitch make up for a minute cause that ship never last
In 1996 niggas is dyin' from layin' on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Easy-E died
And you be wonderin' why you niggas
Out there smokin'cri
I wish that I could tell y'aIl wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that nigga you know that I would be lyin'
And I been f**kin' pussy since the tender age of nine
It's gettin' to be a full-time job just tryin' to stay alive
And crack a scandalous smirk offended by the weed
Smoke comin' of my shirt
But I still put in work and front for my folks
'cause where I come from nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe
Some say that nigga's sellin' dope
And you know I ain't lyin' that just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the devil poke you
With his fork
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophet, f**kin' hoes
And gettin' paid
I'm looking for that
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life
You only got one life to live that's all they give us to do it
You could bullshit your way through it or stay true
It can be complicated cause niggas
Be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the people
In the lane get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive, take your positions
With pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dust
To see the only stretch rest see how we was left to be
Down these streets that we be on
Motherf**kers sleepin' on them corners that you be on
Probably because society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the f**k made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas sellin' that dank
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of the American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on who gives a damn
When you can't afford a turkey or ham
Livin' off of Ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab, it's far from me
To push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your man
And so instead of being without I'm hustlin' tryin' to
Get through these ungodly days
Thinkin' of ways to get the f**k out of this maze
A man'll commit a crime who the& f**k it crime pays
I'm goin' through a phase you don't go out until you
Out reason a motherf**ker
Gots to pour out this 40 on the curb, disturbed and
Left with no doubt in this mind
But still sometimes he don't know why he walkin' around just hopin'
He can get one more try to make it
It's a bullshit he goin' through but yo he gots,
You can't fake it to get the
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life

No matter where I go and no matter who I meet
Everybody tryna tell me how they feel 'bout the South
On the cool, them haters need to shut they fuckin mouth
'Cause we grip grain, nigga we pop trunk
We to' straps and we ready for the funk

Some niggaz just ball wit' a bottle in they hands
Sell a couple ringtones niggaz, that's bread

"Got front and back, and side to side" ---> MC Ren
"Got front and back, and side to side"
"Got front and back, and side to side"
(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush inside ? ? is fresh
Triple gold double-A Dayton's is the best, ugh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cos where I'm from fool that's what everybody play
UGK-1 written smooth on my plates
Cos real pimp players don't never roll fake
I'm bout to hit Dove Way, get past Troy's
I'm dippin by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass by the Colt I see some women lookin fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the trigger so it bump, ugh
I know you player-hatin busters wanna ride man
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy
(Hook - x2)
(Pimp C)
It's pimpin pimpin, I'm hittin switches, checkin out my strap
but I keep on dippin, steady pimpin, kickin, how's about the winter man?
Makin sure these snitches, ain't stoppin riches, 5-Oh on my back
I'm chillin, hidin and winnin, pockets feelin fat
(Bun B)
And I come round your corner shinin, leanin, ever so sunnin
Gangstas put down their gun and
women and children come outside and start runnin
They catch a glimpse of the P-A pimp whoopin whips
Never goin out out like simps, walkin your block with gangsta limp
(Pimp C)
Some fool roll Lincoln, some fools roll Jag
but the crew from Texas roll them Lacs, white gloss and rags
With the candy paint and wheel and grill, and wooden dash
'94 I gotta keep it trill, down for my cash
(Bun B)
I gots my stash so I switches, keep on burnin
and these tyres keep on turnin
I be rollin through your scene, flashin green, freaks be yearnin
to be down, the Under Ground Kingz drinkin Crown with the Coke
Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby
(Hook - x2)
(Bun B)
It's the tough boy, boulevard niggas, rollin around tan up
All four corners on your block fool, nuttin but that bunny hop
happenin, high gassin, daily routine, my load is plush
Interior crush and fool I'm through clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
in your soul so letta player take control
And do what the hell ya been waitin
to see and that's me rollin on three Dayton's
Wit one of them thangs in the air, it's hangin up there
Shinin steel fat man, but I don't care if everybody sit back and stare
Everywhere we go they linin up as if we're startin up a parade
And everybody thinkin they get paid
But I don't really give a damn, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
on a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right
(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
Never let broke gold diggers ride
Never let broke gold diggers ride
"Got front and back, and side to side"
Never let broke gold diggers ride
"Got front and back, and side to side"
"Got front and back, and side to side"
Never let broke gold diggers ride

<SONGSTART>Dear Lord, I know You don't condone
The things I be doin' out here in these streets
And I hope that, I pray that You can overlook
The wrong that I had done in my life
I don't know no other way to survive out here
I got a whole bunch of people dependin' on me
Just walk with me, walk with me
Busslin' and gamblin', hit licks scramblin'
Bricks, I'm out here handlin', I'm pimpin' and I'm payin' the rent
Didn't choose this dirty game, this dirty game, it chose me
Every city love cocaine, they'll get it from him
If they don't get it from me
So I get cross-country with that thang
Makin' that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin' that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
'Cause I put up sum from every sale so all my children can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell
But just put me in woodgrain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that sweet down 'cause that bullshit don't apply to me
'Cause out here on the real streets a dreamer always stay sleep
'Cause out here the strong survive
And now they didn't die from thankin' weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it hard, still tryna get right with God
Still read my Bible lone 'cause Reverend do wrong, still livin' fraud
Tonight if I get down on my knees
And ask the Lord to forgive me, please
You thank He gon' hear me?
'Cause tomorrow I'm still gon' be slangin' ki's
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
See, I was born in the ghetto, manye, I was raised in the hood
And unless you lived it yourself, it just can't be understood
People think hustlin' is cool or hustlin' is live
They don't understand hustlers only hustlin' to survive
They wished they lived in the 'burbs, wished they didn't have to hang
Out on corners in low-income house in projects and slang
They wish their daddy was home, mama wasn't on drugs
And they didn't have to grow up to be dealers and thugs
Po' children got aspirations and dreams just like the wealthy
But it's hard when that environment you live in ain't healthy
You ain't givin' no hope, nobody showin' you pride
And you live with all this anger and frustration inside
Dog, don't let nobody tell you what you can or you can't do
Just 'cause they funky ass couldn't do it, they ain't you
You can be who you wanna be, live life how you feel
Just put your faith in the Lord, now that's keepin' it trill fo' real
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's
For all the niggaz in the game that's been slangin' cheese
For all them boys on them swangers and their fifth wheel
I'm out here riskin' my life, niggaz shife but I stay trill
I pray so much, I wonder if the Lord love me
I think He do but I'm so caught up in my thug deep
The feds bug me, followin' me around for three
Niggaz couldn't catch me so they hit me with conspiracy
You know that that's the other level of the game
Ain't got shit on me but some niggaz said my name
So here they come, they thang tight
They playin' shife, no Bun, givin' me life
I ain't goin' back, I'm a make 'em kill me
I'ma bust back, fuck the pen, you feel me?
Wish I can hug my momma and kiss my baby girl
I know it's a better place than livin' in this dirty world
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Some people win and some people lose
Some always cryin' the blues, yeah
Some people win, some people lose
Some always bein' misused
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
'Cause I need You, Lord, right now
I need You, right now
Need Ya, I need Ya, I need Ya
I need Ya 'cause I'm goin' and livin' too fast, yeah
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Out here livin' too fast, how long can it last?
I can't get up, Lord, can You help me?
Lord, can You help me? Can You help me?
Can You help me, right now, yeah

Im campaignin for a new Benz
On the rims with bubble lenz
Im stackin' every dollar i see 100s 50s 20s and 10s
Doors open doors close never sweat hoes playas get yo's
Hustle and flow cars clothes thats the playa like that i know
Roll the dank up where the dro?
Pour the drank up where the fo's
Stackin money all on the low and we still ridin dirty
Got a drop top on them rollerskates
Candy jolly rancher paint
Enjoyin the spoils of hard work and grind more tryin to get bank
I dont know what them boys thinkin my motivation is benjamin franklin
Im tryin to maintain this wealth that i been calculatin
Gettin money thats all i know
On my toes never off my note
Woodgrain and hundred spokes i wave the trunk just like a pro
I grind its off to work i go I hustle hard its no stop
And if i flop i switch to hustle
I learned the game then set up shop
Im strivin' to make it to the top
Its all or nothin no turnin back
Im with them boys out on the block
Accumulating them paper stacks
Im makin money this where its at
Whatever it takes crack or jack
In love with my money and thats a fact
And we STILL RIDIN' DIRTY
Right now we got the 5th wheel reclinin
Trunk popped up screens fallin from the sky
Candy paint sprayed by eddie and im ridin on that glassy chrome
all courtesy of my hustle game
Real hustlin's in my blood line
I dont complain or whine
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make
a dime I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind but now i see that road to riches
Its a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs
I peep game from the best and since then i been playin chess
I put in work with no rest
To get that paper thats my quest
Im on the slow grind towards success
One of the best 'cause i keep it fresh
Im one hundred isnt nothin less
And im STILL RIDIN' DIRTY
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Gawd-DAYUM! I don't know what y'all been thinkin bout
But I think this right here is about to shut dem damn haters down!
I'm from the streets that make niggaz walk slow talk low
With white chalk-o, mi casa be siete uno ocho
Brooklyn motherfucker, handle this - pardon my Spanish and French (Brooklyn baby!)
Okay, I stay clever like Mayweather with lay leather
'til your face sever, one of the greatest ever
Beyond ringing bells, my name's so demanding
Shit! - I got the swagger that'll leave Dakota "Fanning" (That boy still standing!)
I hope you niggaz over standing; I stay sucker-free
The next kaing of in the game, you ain't got enough to be
Your career last a week, that'll be luckily
Fuck with me, the rap game'll need protective custody
(AHH!) I'm the same thug to be, surrounded with women
Gave the game "True Religion" before you found it in denim
Feel the, "Wrath of Kane, " and you could not escape
The hip-hop version of "The Ring" and you just watched the tape (Next up!)
And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We Trill workin the wheel, understand nigga? (UNDERSTAND?)
I smother and split a bitch down to the tendon
High pressure, if you don't break your ass bendin
I'm way past endin in my series of warnin
You flex with me tonight playa you dead by the mornin (Woo!)
Bun Beater the best ever breathin or deceased
From the South to Midwest, Cali to the East
Got to any city nigga and bring my name up (all o'em!)
I bet I eat the best rapper they got in the game up
Call a nigga up, email him or chirp him
Make a meal out his motherfuckin ass and then burp him
(DAYUM!) Don't fuck around I'm not your lil' homey
I'm the king of the underground so act like you know me (Next up!)
Feel me...
Homie, we big steppin, big reppin
We givin kids Smith & Wesson's lessons, you get left with a sketchin
Left with the Midwest, clique Texans (who dat?)
G. and Daddy Kane, the click Texas, (word) pop you to death
I put private planes on swift Jetsons, niggaz know what it is
When you see the ball cap and a slick Thessons (woo!)
(Aight) Til you strip vexing to a movie clip from the Westerns
Shit from the Uzi clip lift up your midsection (Tell em G. Rap)
He will introduce you to the nose on the Glock fam
Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band (rock band!)
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man (AOOOW!)
High roller dose some hoes on the cock plan
Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin cheese til the rubberbands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em "Hot Pants" (Next up!)
I make your girl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt
I'm a young hot street flame (Flame)
They call me Sweet James, or call me Sir Jones
Two hundred dollar cologne
(Uh!) Board Nine, or Issey Miyaki
I got your girl mine, meat strong like saki
I ain't Rocky but I keep her rockin
Fuck around I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket
Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin watchin my top fall in
On my Lambourghini with the quick scream
Fettucini, linguini, shrimp and a bowl of lean!
What you know about gettin cross country
Nigga your piece big but your diamond look monkey
You need to take that shit back
That ain't no emmy diamonds what the fuck you done to that...

Now, damn somebody need to beat Jacob's ass over that!

It's on a, work somethin, twerk somethin basis
Makin big change, dancin in them tricks faces

You kiss that thang and I'm out, cause she been playin with my pipe

A little sly delight, I done pushed my pride aside
Just to slide inside, man I done died tonight
Now what I'm 'sposed to do? Been got close to you
Lookin like a poster to, don't wanna boast but you Missus
Do a Dr. Feel good, lay a playa real good
Limpin came back, and it was still good, she will
Put a few tips in her mouth, that's that definition
Of them true chicks in the South, let me do my thang
On the cool quick to the crotch, get the beds but guess what?

But now the chicks they call me James Jones
And if I skip I'm back to D-slangin, keep them boys nod-headed
Keep the boppers with they butts swangin

Now I leave them gulls with they jellyroll swollen, I'm rollin
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

<SONGSTART>Use me up, I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin' my mind

'Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin' my car
And everyday it get better, I can't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin' she ain't nothin' but a scrub
But she make me feel high like I'm hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I can't help myself, I know that I'm trippin'
But she got it goin' on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my credit card
You know she get it 'cause ya know that
(Chill, C)
I know, G, I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin' pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin' aw'll limp
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and still ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin' good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin' out them duckets and them, croka sacks
And everybody wonderin' why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, ask me why I wanna dis her
I told her 'cause her lovin' ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin' out and Byrd say I'm trippin' too
But this time I just can't listen to my whole crew
'Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But ninety two came around and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin' me

To sum it all up, I'm breakin' all my rules
'Cause she got me droppin' off her little brother to school

But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food

Candy sweets, a candy bitch, you lookin' at a candy boy

Hopin' these niggas don't blast today
Pro smoke, pro choke, anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take it, trick, I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya

Grippin' my steal, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
They tellin' me, "Bun, don't go there", but man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas but scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout or smokin' that joint 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain, and leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em from P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em, wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em to hell, to heaven
I just spent 60 G's on a brand new Eldo-reeze
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac, north star fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke when my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch 'cuz I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant, '84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed down Screw tapes that knock, blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks, try 20 ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas

Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play, it don't change, ain't a thang to say
It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go
Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers, body rockers
Late night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerrilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us
Touched like Midas, these bitch ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch ass niggas ain't got no cheese?
Blowin' big kill
(Blowin' big kill)
Million dollar deals

Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

with a piece of chain or Herringbone or nugget (nugget)
That don't mean him a real live hoe
You ain't ready to roll then go on then, fuck it
Out them ducats, hoes better recognize
Niggaz better recollect, Bun finna regulate
I hit yo' town (what) find me a hoe stroll
Leave that bitch dry and head to another state (hold up)
Me and my brother can't wait when it come to the red
Cause we about that cash, cash
So if we can't convince ya we'll take your sister
Hit the highway and mash
You got, bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got, bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got, bitches that can and you got bitches that cain't
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch
Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care
I like the girl with the pussy hair
My partner Mike Mo like the pussy bare
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swang Big Dick, swang Sweet Jones
Go and get the myth out the cobra head
Girl got down you niggaz scared
I got a young yellow bitch, I'ma sing it loud
With a four-inch corner of jet-mink hair
Between her legs is where it great
And get the money out the nigga when she go on a date
I stay caked up, rocked up
Magnum rubbers stay socked up
I ain't tryin to get the wet dick
Hold my good but she ain't that slick
I know you want this high-dollar cum
Bitch know I got money, wanna get her some
Bitch you must, done lost your mind
The trick's niggaz over there, you better get on the grind
Bitches not flexin ain't much good
I should and I would keep clear if I could
But when I do I just CAWN'T get away
Cause I gotta fuck all day every day
That leaves me run loco for real
All these chickenheads lie about deal
Ain't gotta do it up to make me chill
Find a good spot on the floor and kneel!
Know that my heart's in between my fires
Though I can't take when they look in my eyes
Lookin for love that's no surprise
Comin up off, that's family ties
Then I hit it from the back, all the way
Slap that back and just lock cross say
Not freeze out without no delay
Girls in the chat, I ain't got shit to say

Ain't from Atlanta but I know these hoes like me
They pulling on my zipper wanna bite me
I got a bitch from Oakland like to get hyphe
In the bed with her head in a jib
Eating on my dick like it's some corn or a barbeque rib

With the juicy tank top and a loop of ten heels
All bullshit aside, she looking ready to kill

She ain't watching the clock, ain't finna answer the phone

With three Rap Album of the years
And no Album of the year given
Honestly, Screw the Grammies
I feel directed by this Sam Raimi
But this Spiderman ain't too happy
Where's my Mary Jane Watson
Where my options, Quit my job
Quit loven her, leave college, no, quit stopping
Comin down the walls, used to
Be afraid to fall, cause Life is
About picking yourself up
Coming down like an angel
No one on this Earth is hear to save you
Comin down like 100 percent
Fresh from head to toe, like

Some mean shit, I just don't talk cold

Feel like they're starting fires
And igniting flames, anything
To take down No Came down
Taken for a conviction of triple
Murder, Rubin Carter's life was murdered,
Just like a black man criticized for controversy
Sometimes I start my own, most lies do hurt me
Coming down like a homicide victim,
Just cause I look and sound different
Comin down like James Bond, I'm on another
Mission 005.7 like the rate of homicide victims
Violent crimes are hard to retire, they never Will
I am fucking legend even if I am killed
I'm still that potion, to put haters
In to the motion, Say I'm the reason
For most to believe in, Let's say I'm everything

Comin up, all I wanted to
Be in high school was a jock
A homecoming king, a volley-
Ball player, a boxer, a rockstar, a Rodney King
But no rapper has me beat
An actor, a rocker, a baseball
Player, a professional wrestler
Similar to Brock Lesnar
Even a ladies man, a bodybuilder
Once again a boxer, a skilled dribbler
A debater, snowboarder
A triathlete, a break dancer
Now I hate dancing, a wake boarder
Even a cheerleader, more like
A peer mediator, Who am I
Where's my first breath
Took profound leaps in every step,
I was even into football, ob course
Basketball, bring it soccer, even tennis
Can't stop winning, it's addictive
Life is a game board until you finish it
Even a lifeguard, but I still can't swim

<SONGSTART>So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F**k it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"

Sweet jones
My bitch a choosey lover, never f**k without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like the f**k for 40 dollars in the club
f**king up the game, bitch you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Bun B:)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B U N B
Cause what's a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoes?
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get jones
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi:)
Eni mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-saw pole
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b**** is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, walk it off from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooh ooh

I, I choose you baby

These laws be trippin' 'cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it in cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living a Mac
And I ain't trippin', flippin' then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
'Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees

Got boppers that's steady jockin, goofy niggaz in my ear
Bitch I'ma self-made trillionaire, get your soft ass outta here
Weak niggaz wanna plead their case (case), just to raise up out my face (face)
I ain't got that time to waste, punch your mouth and knock out the taste
You MySpacin and Facebookin, playin games with them toys
I'm in the streets where gangstas meet, while you're online with them boys
So step your game up, build your name up, quit your talkin and quit your doin
All that planning and contemplating. when the f**k you gon' start pursuing?
Cars ain't driving themselves, mansions ain't building themselves
They waiting for Annie Mae and they need to stop feelin themselves

But that somethin they won't know 'til they learn it, while burnin...
(Pimp C)

<SONGSTART>Uhhhhhhhh ~!
If you know like I know you would get down on the flo'
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisha full of 'dro
We can get down for my dime and we can f**k, on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha f**kin with me fo'?
Every lady ain't a hoe and every hoe ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't f**k around with no punks
Ride with me she holdin a pistol while I'm whippin and poppin the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems 'long as she hear what the f**k I said
Pimpin ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here livin by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm lookin at you you choosin me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm superstar, we headed to the top
(Chorus: sung)
I'm stayin true, I'm out here whippin my Mercedes
F**kin with the midnight ladies - the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm bangin Screwwww, my young girl lookin fine
We stayin out here on the grind - and keepin money on our mi-ii-iind
(Bun B:)
Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, gotta feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster-ass persona so hard it can dent, steel
In the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leakin fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust

Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leakin out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you gotta go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Gotta pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Gotta play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's yo' turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a f**k how you feel
(Chorus)
(Pimp C:)
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the SOOOOOOOOOUTH
This scary hoe don't wanna know what it's ABOOOOOOOOUT
Cause I stay country true down to the co', dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws, feel it tighten up don't stop don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars, f**k the D.A. f**k the law
I f**k the snow but I love a pro like flatbackers I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer, drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker, bitch around me man I'ma mack her
(Bun B:)
From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of 'dro and Impala bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki', and ten kilos grams in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's one point five mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is tickin, time is pressin
No second guessin, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK
(Chorus)
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S H O R T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be living naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell
I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fucking maker
'Cause I ain't taking, no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts
Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch
This dope ain't yo dope and these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafucking guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafucking road
And don't even try to come back nigga, yo
'Cause me Dre and C got fingers on a fat trigger
We making too much money moving weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper booming cold blow yo ass up
And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailing on yo bitch ass
But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas
Niggaz on the track dropping shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cooking up some llello for the local drug king
The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slanging some more white dust
Real, oh, so trill, the life's no glamor
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fucking up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home
And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales
Stupid muthafuckas smoking dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fighting Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops finding my stash, yo what could the worst be
Through so going undercover then turning dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Calling my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas
I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't 'bout to sell no fucking dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope but you still ain't selling shit
Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon' let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafucking cuts
So step in like I said before, we'll take them muthafucking nuts
Ask the last nigga brought his fucking ass down
Trying to sell that fucking dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'm a go to Port Arthur and run them fucking niggaz
Brought his fucking gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac
Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope
Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
'Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafucking killas
So have your shit attached, before you come check us
Pimp C, bitch, P.A. home, Short Texas

Underground Kingz for life, young Pimp C
Put my first record out, at the age of 16
Rapping 'bout moving work, candy painted symphony
We was the first niggaz, talking 'bout wood wheel
Made up the word, that's why I'm so trill
Now everybody, wanna bite my swagger
Roll like a stone, like my name Mick Jagger
Say it befo', had to tell you hoes again
Run a drum machine, like my name Roger Men
Write the rhyme do the beat, the hook and the mix

I went gold, but never sold my soul to bang
And bitch I'll hit you with that thang, I'm a underground kingz
Kingz, kingz

T R I double L, that's with capital letters man
The Pimp and the Bun, Bobby U.N. and J.R.
Big Dick Cheney, and Tony Snow you know who they are

Fucking cowards get out the way, 'cause the rap game's ours
Y'all niggaz, better reco'
That you ain't gotta like me, but you gon' respect me hoe

Fuck the fame want the change, it's been fun

UHH...
Dedicated to all the underdogs, knahmtalkinbout?
Muthafuckas told me I wasn't gon be shit...
Told me I was gon be able to do this rap shit...
Knahmtalkinbout? My own family talked down on me, knahmsayin?
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (My uncle told me I wasn't gon be shit)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (I used to walk around with a bag full of rappers)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
(Motherfucker told me, a nigga from Texas couldn't make no record)
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
(Then after I made the record, muh'fuckers said they would never give us no respect)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... (But now they tryna rap like us)
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah... (Tryna be like us, tryna smell like us)
(Knahmtalkinbout?)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money... (Check this out)
[Pimp C:]
Man I refuse to let the bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up, but they cain't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a hoe open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a hoe for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
(right... right...)
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (hmm...)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (hmm...)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho...
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money...
[Pimp C:]
To all the babies havin babies on ya' own
I know you feelin fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, "Ya fucked up your life"
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy with lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggaz tellin you, "Ya crazy"
"What you thankin? You too young to have a family"
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggaz ain't gon ride witchu
But get down with that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin
It's time to change sumthin...
[Chorus]
[Pimp C:]
If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, "It ain't enough room in the NBA"
You tell them haters, "Save that bullshit for another day"
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, "You ain't gon make it", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase to hog it up, the lawyer end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be shame and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right...
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
... (Uh!)

They call me Mick Jagger 'cause I 'Roll a lot of stones'
It's a whole lot of clones but only one Sweet Jones
Turnin' whores to carnivores, they just can't leave my meat alone
It's been a long time since I busted on a glock
But every corner that I hit, I left it screwed up and chopped
Marooned up and dropped, like my Biarritz on top
Let the motherfucker bleed until it drip and let it drop
I'm still that young boy that had a pocket full of stones
But now I'm sick and simply rich, grippin' wood and flippin' chrome
I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key

Man I pull up in your city and get my Bush on
Lay down the competition, take their cash crops and get my push on
Moved up to Bentley with more chrome from a Lexus key
All because we cornered the market on that Texas tee
And we don't bar no plexes, we way bigger than other men though
The diamond deuces on tinted windows, we in the wind yo
We 'Chevro way' the wind blow, that's the corner we been Joe
Don't know where you been bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though
When it's ten fo', good, but in my Styrofoam good and muddy
We block bleeders, leavin' your neighborhoods good and bloody
We grippin' that woodler, bud it, sit back and scope it
Pay attention to Prince and pushin' everything about to pump it

Uh, I done smashed up my flyin' spurt, it wasn't shit
I just parked it in the grass and brought some brand new shit
A Phantom Rolls Royce, 24's with the bump
I ain't trippin' about the seat, I got them woofers in my trunk
Cut in my swisher, codeine on my whiskers
Fuckin' with that Smoke D, Bundy and that Vicious
UGK Records, it's an institution
Know a lot of niggaz livin' off of prostitution
Pimpin' ain't dead, it just moved to the web
Bitch ain't gotta hit the track, ain't gotta give no tricks no head
Ain't got to give no tricks, no pussy, just cameras and screams
Easiest money you can get, it's the American Dream bitch
Man I'm a middle finger figure, a million dollar mission
Poppin' like Orville Redenbacher, with a whippin' in the kitchen
Yayo like Dontrelle Willis, we the trillest on the mound
I'm holdin' that whole South down, I know you feel us
We the realest walkin' the planet
Can't stand it, pass away, wanna fight us
Start to swingin', wanna kill us, blast away, wanna stab us
Get to stickin but make sure you cut us deep
'Cause I betcha we comin' back a couple hundred brothers deep
Pimp and Bun, we run the streets, which streets? Man, pick your hood
Don't matter, we represented, cross us? We gon' get you good

Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin, on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin, on me, they wanna fuck my car
Look a nigga up and down like he a superstar
But they ain't trippin, on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are by far
They ain't trippin on me, they wanna fuck my car
Ay C keep yo' eyes open for the boppers, car hoppers
Daisy Dukes out on the block, showin cock, traffic stoppers
Lookin good spendin some nigga G's
Nails by Vietnamese, [unverified], lookin' like they worth G's
Dress above they knees, jellies and G-strings up the ass
Man I never let 'em pass
So, tell me where can I find 'em
With they nigga or in that candy Cadillac right behind him
Bitches tellin' me see yo' dick grand
All she wanna do is ride Su-bur-ban
Put her ass on the leather and rub the wood
See we got boppers in Texas oh, man that pussy look good
So, I let them hoes ride and I show them a grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
When she told me I looked good I didn't feel no pride
All the bitch wanted to do is just fuck my ride
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
Look a nigga up and down like he a superstar
But they ain't trippin on me, they wanna fuck my car

Oh yeah, these hoes think they cute in skin-tight catsuits
Assumin' that they body's too boomin to dispute
But pussy is the root of all drama
An attribute put up in they head by they momma
Oh yeah, I'ma tell it like it is, I sees how it goes down
Niggaz talkin' 'bout, how they passin' these hoes 'round
But y'all trickin', them hoes told me
Fools y'all ain't Goldy, ridin' in a goodie but an oldie
Fifty dollars there, a hundred dollars here
You brought the bitch a drink and all her homegirls a beer
Your homeboys lookin for ya, but yo' ass gone
You left your niggaz at the club and took all them hoes home
And didn't even fuck, man what the fuck
If you didn't want to fuck then get the fuck up out the truck
You know what I mean? I ain't showin out Vogues
Just so these hoes can be seen, c'mon you wanna fuck or cut?
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
When you look at my chrome and you lick your lips
It's just like I'm rubbin' my dick between your hips
And when you smile and shake your ass, my grill smile right back
Bitch I'm the real, that's why I ride Cadillac
And I'ma fuck you and fuck all yo' friends
Soon as Pimp C come through in that 600 Benz
With burgundy paint, butter and LG rims
Color TV, VCR playin X-rated films
Of myself, runnin up in beauty queens
But let me tell y'all niggaz the difference between y'all and me
You see, man I can tell all that bitch wanted to do
Is just ride for free and smoke for free
But bitch not me, you better ask them hoes if my name Pimp C
Unless your pussy makin ten thousand dollars a week
The only way I see you sittin in my passenger seat, you bitch!
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car

Verse 1 (pimp c):
I'm coming down candy, i put in my work

the game's been good
and all the hoes wanna sit on leather and the wood
bitches tryin' to price my diamonds
but that shit is just so common
'cause they see a nigga shinin'

i'm comin' down gulf way, i'm tryin' to see what's up

the attitude's shitty but i bought no plex
ain't talkin' 'bout the malcolm but i'm ridin' on the x
the highway was so wet, i'm slippin' out my lane
the bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
i bet you never seen a big truck like that
i bet you never got a dick sucked like that
the bitch didn't know that i was tapin' the whole scene
now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen
the glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
i got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
tryin' to close me down, but i got ghetto love
i'm pimp c bitch, i'm comin' down richer than rich
so bitch you know you gotta gimme good stuff
Chorus:
Lookin' for that good stuff

ba ba ba ba da da da

comin' down on fresh paint
blowin' swisher sweet smoke
Verse 2 (bun-b):
We flippin' worldwide, p.a.t. international jetsetters
bigger than the hollywood letters
but don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
breakin' off the jealous with pitch black barettas
my fellas and tellers who holdin' plates against them texas boys
bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex
like you major boy you have done played yourself
too $hort smoked you like a newport, and you bought
a one-way ticket to something bigger than you
over your head and got scared
exactly what i figured you'd do
now who you kiddin', i'm slangin', bangin', and skiddin'
busta playa moves and if you done it and did it
as i sit in the lap of luxury
dea is tryin' to stick bugs to me
undercover motherfucker tried to sell drugs to me
what could be more throw
mafioso puttin' bombs under my load
never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
now i'm comin' down shinin'
pieces and chains full of diamonds
i'm winin' and dinin' and caligula
pretty boys gettin' off the hook
bitches sayin' but i'm diggin' ya

Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin-swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
[Pimp C:]
When the top starts fallin the bitches start callin
My trunk start bangin and the fo's start crawlin
The drank mixed up, in the cream soda bottle
Her lips, hit my dick that's why I smashed on the throttle
Swisha Sweet candy, Robert Davis in my cup
I'm swervin like Bootsy but I couldn't give a fuck (fuck)
You see this car? (You see this car?)
You see this truck? (You see this truck?)
They both for me now watch them girls get buck (buck)
Ain't shit friendly but we still have fun (fun)
UGK for life, you know the Pimp and the Bun (Bun)
The great state of Texas, candy in the Lexus
Dick for them hoes jaws, pistols for the flexers
Somebody asked me why I'm ridin on the East
All I did was told the truth, the bullshit niggaz cease (cease)
If you ain't hatin nigga why the fuck you mad?
If your records ain't sellin, get your fingers out ya ass, bitch!
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Well it's the king of the trill (trill) wood wheel in my palm (palm)
Yeah I'm sittin sideways on suedes smokin that bomb (bomb)
The granddaddy kush mixed with a little O.G. (fo' sho')
That's my breakfast, off top I gotta blow three
Not to mention codeine, liquid and the pill (pill)
Bloats on my grill with my hand on my steel (steel)
Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing
I'ma gon' and pop the trunk, surely but slowly
Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your Colby Jet system (no)
Your slab ain't holdin, ain't no use to you frontin
And I'm fin' to shut the game down when I push the button
And the... [echoes]
[Chorus]
[Cory Mo:]
Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang
Cory Mo about to do the damn thaaaaang
In the butter guts with the diamond in the back
King Kongs in the trunk, hit the switch and watch it crack
I'ma let my paper stack and quote nothin but facts
So don't "ax" me nothin partner 'less you droppin some cash (cash)
Now she hoppin it fast (fast) that's just how I like it (like it)
Turn around and show me somethin girl I'm gettin excited (oooh)
Ain't nobody trippin cause the money already made
I done said it befo', so I'ma say it again
And let my top drop dowwwwwn
[Chorus]
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>It all started with a Pimp C, bitch
So what the fuck is up?
Told 'em somethin' good
Ease up my muthafuckin' cut
'Cause if you don't really wanna fuck wit a trill nigga
From the trill villa wit a steel trigga land of the real killers
Pop pop muthafucka there you go
I'ma bust 'em on yo ass if you don't ease up off me ho
'Cause trill niggas don't carry no sugar in they nutsac
Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack
So you gon' give me my money but you don't hear me though
But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes
P.A. nigga, trill ass nigga
How you figga you can buck me down nigga?
Mr. big an, Mr. big time, give me what's mine
Instead of buying cars for a bitch named sunshine
Give me what's mine, give me what's mine
Before it come down to triggas
Shit, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Bitch, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Uh, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
But you can't hear me
It's the return of the trill ass niggas bitch
Yea muthfuckas, I figured you run
I figured you run, when I pull triggas to guns
That triggas to guns P.A. fool a nigga named Bun
A nigga named Bun, no more sun, no more shine
Say hello to the nine milly millameter
(Buck, buck, buck)
Money tight glock, bustin' them shots
When I break yo ass off somethin' hot
Niggas steady catchin' lead to the head
I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin' bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin', niggas start passin' away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise, I'm gettin' Chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now it's the return of the trill ass niggas

Frontline comin' down on twenty four inches
Dope boys hangin' on the corners and the benches
Sayin' it's a drout so it's plenty of heat pinches
Boy, used to come up from the rags to the riches
Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches
But now it's like the game is full of nothin' but some snitches
And wanna be gangsters that's scared to put 'em in ditches
Fed's takin' pictures so the cameras go click
And video rollin' while I'm holdin' my dick
They follow me around like they doin' they job
But while you watchin' me how many people gettin' robbed
Lets keep it trill 'cause we already know
What it already is and how it already go
That's why we chop blades comin' down real slow
Pop trunks, swang, riders slam Cadillac door
Pass the swisha let's blow
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Before we get started, every body roll up one for Pimp C
Before we go any further, take your lighter, light it up for me
Now let's go, now let's go and all the girls get down on the floor
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know

Put your hands in the air raise 'em up for Pimp C

Still I fits, out, cause she thick, stout
With the feminine fat, in all the right places
She look me in my eyes and she make all the right faces
Cause she's a real catch, we make a tough pair
A true dynamic duo and we up there
We sittin tall at the top
And if she ride or die for me playa I'm a give her all that I got
I break her off and not, let her hold the keys

[Bun B]
A bad day for the niggaz in my click
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It's seems the drug situation is so tow up
And poes down the fuckin T-X had to show up
I got shit on the scene so 99 can't hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret and there's no rest
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
In Dynasties.I-ROCs... and Caravans and muthafuckas are swolen
Like paper stacks and a rubberband
Goin all out of tact on the local bird slaggin brothaman
And be servin as slow as fuck
Cause my niggaz are nervous
and if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggaz is happy with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town
Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my tags off my buick and yall know I didn't love that
Rollin on some white balls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, YOU GOTS TO DO YOUR OWN NAILS!
I told my niggaz to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town
God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back up!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my click
Got the birds, and reopen my lab back up
And told my boys, "If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye,
Don't give him a chance to identify!"
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at random, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Close to the dopeman - God damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
CAUSE IN MY YARD IS A BIG ASS - I GOT YALE SIGN!
It's time for TONY MONTANA stacks
I got niggaz on the corner holdin big ass bags and cans of crack
The land of Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fools run in with your glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last love
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight lights
when the feds in town
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

Comin' down on the slab, boy
Ridin' dirty, for real tho, ridin' dirty
Have you ever been rollin' in a clean ass 'Lac
Blowin' big out the window, everybody got a sack
Got my heat right between my seat, got a box of them thangs
In case these fools start playin' with me
You'd be surprised how them boppers wink, girl, I can't stop
Give my headlights a blink and roll them up out the top
And keep movin' and keep rollin'
Fools that don't be holdin' I'm comin' through and foldin'
And I can't stand snitches, wanna kill all of y'all
Even though some bustas fall I'm still rollin' like a ball
And having things my way, hittin' that highway
Sellin' that big yay, a plush-ass place to stay
Police, they wanna run in
Talkin' on cell phones got a lotta kids done in
I wanna live like Arnold, Willis and Mr. Drummond
And keep my paper sturdy, big birds and tight herbs
Fool, I'm ridin' dirty
Big birds and tight herbs, fool I'm ridin' dirty
Ridin' dirty, fool, ridin' dirty
Tell me can you feel it? Man, nothin' can save ya
I believe it's that season for gettin' yo papers
Or haven't you heard about them birds? We call it that cheese
In Texas we get it with ease, hit I-10 if you please
But these polices, they think they sharp as creases
For no reasons, man, they straight up strippin' cars to pieces
Out of suspicion or if they thinkin' you on a mission
Ain't no wishin' or prayin', they sayin' assume the position
Hands behind ya head, down on ya knees
You get the case and they get yo weight and yo G's
Come on, I use to ride the Port Arthur city streets
With a chick with pretty feets and a box of Philly Sweets
They tried to finish me but couldn't get it done
So somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty
Man, somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty

One with a trigger, two with a bat
Three big brothers, fo' - wanna squab with me
So I guess a brother gotta throw
Tell 'em like this, ya better get up out my camp dude
Befo' I have to pull my gat and get, real rude
I don't figure that it's worth gettin hurt
Just 'cause ya gal wanna give me that skirt
Bet it feels funny when ya doin 69
Knowin that ya sippin on all my jimmy wine
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bad
Knowin that ya swallowed all the skeeter that I had?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda shot you up instead I told ya somethin good
[Chorus: sampled from Chaka Khan & Rufus' "Something Good"]
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah... yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
[Bun B:]
Aiyyo, what's up with that bulge in ya khakis?
You wanna pack a gat, but you STILL ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gangload of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cause by yourself, you're runnin to the flo'
I seen your kind befo', man ya nothin with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin when ya chillin with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin up some daisies
See crazy you wanna be, but punks with no heart, they ain't hard
They just waitin for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep your weak self locked in ya hood
Cause without your boys I'm a have to tell ya somethin good
[Chorus]
(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)
[Pimp C:]
Brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check ya girl and what she did in the past
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her REAL fast
But I don't trust the dugout, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check ya blood and let somebody check your teeth
But if you don't step, I'm a drop on ya fast
And pump off bullets like government cash
I didn't do ya girl but your sister was alright
Took her to my homeboy's Caddy last night [girl moaning in the background]
She waxed my jimmy, and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit if from the back, and the girl just THREW ME
Told me, "Pump it harder, " and she scratched me on my BOOTY
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty lil' girl
[Chorus 1/2]
[Bun B:]
Let's talk about these half-n-half punks
By day they sorry bastards, at night they talkin bout, poppin trunks
Butter .25 cain't keep you alive
From a sawed-off, fool so I hope you survive
See bluffin might save ya tail one day
But who's ta say, it won't catch ya next week, on the runway?
You might shoot a few shots in the wind
But the same time tomorrow, you'll be runnin again
Now can you keep it up, every damn night?
You steady runnin to the argument but runnin from the fight
What's the deal man? Why don't you take your Raiders cap off?
Cause one of these days, you gonna getcha head slapped off
You cain't keep a crew cause they gettin sick of seein you bail
Like a punk'll hit the backstreet trail
And the women don't like you cause ya act like them
And that's why your little jimmy never went fo' a swim
Ya talk about slangin, makin G's
But I saw a fiend chase ya from, BJ's up to Mickey D's
Now everyday punks get took
Either for they dough, they'll ride 'em for the powder that they cook
You bookin from the scene cause ya couldn't hold ya own
A 40 ounce bottle slams, ya dead to your dome
Now you want revenge, so ya get your automatic
Find a group of hard-heads, and startin kickin static
Ya pulled ya little chrome but these fools got gats
Try to run and caught two buckshots in ya back
Now you nothin but a memory that's gone in a slayin
So when I tell you somethin good, punk I don't be playin

Pimpin' ain't no illusion,
And pimpin' ain't never died.

Got all these hoes thinkin'

Mo' like... Peter Parker.
P-I-M-P, take the P's that I am.
I want you payin' hoes in my army

And we gon' jam...
I'm talkin' 'bout the world greatest show
I know my shit is extreme
But I'm all about them does.
When I'm steppin' on the scene
Be there four deep... hella clan
My reality is your favorite dream

Best believe Kool Ace gon' keep it real.

Excuse me, y'all, but this about Southern shit.

Pimpin' ain't no illusion...

[Pimp C:]
Pimpin' ain't dead... nigga, it just began
(How the fuck you know Sweet Jones?)
My hoes still out there sellin' ass.
Yo' bitch is out of pocket,
'Cause yo' pimpin' was scary;
Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy.
Fuck niggas watch them mack and pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what y'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'.
This is the conclusion: pimpin' ain't no illusion.
[Chorus: x2]
Bun B:
If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her,
'Cause a beggar ain't a muthafuckin' chooser.
Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean.
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a wif a this...
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior... and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny... sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again... that's why...
[Chorus: x2]
Too $hort:
You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money... it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game.
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it.
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin'...beeyatch.

<SONGSTART>So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part."
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it"
"Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets"
"Had to tie her to a rocket"
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up"
"Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up"
"(Shit)"

Niggas ain't real, must'a started smokin' rocks

While these bitches suckin' dick

Keep a bad yellow bitch
On my team, sippin' lean
Ain't no thang of the past
The '84 Beritz with the slant back ass
Keepin' me a pro, next to my fo'
Instead of stackin' cheese
He steady screamin' to that hoe, let me see it
Fuck ass nigga, fuck ass nigga

Nigga, everybody rappin' like they ballin' and they rich

They diamonds ain't shinin' and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm grippin' on the grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm workin' wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville, your step daddy can get killed
If he keeps talkin' shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you tryin' to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the South
For them niggas and them girls with them golds in they mouth
The boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill, bitch you ain't what this about, about
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit

We ain't got nothin' to gain but I got everythin' to lose
So I'm forever bring the blues to the issue
Pick and choose if I miss ya, stick and move when I diss ya
Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, it was made for me to gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my
Flow fly, dope my, wait awhile you know why? Why?
Too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars, baby ballin'
Bullshitter, frontin' like rottweiliers, no bark, no bite
But showin' thangs, talkin' loud like they knowin' thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane, your ass mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight, it ain't no passin' tonight
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit

Waitin' for me to fall but yet they comin' off the wall
Till I'm ready, keep the gun steady and ready
For anybody crossin' the line with get that fuck shit

Got the radio on pump when I come through a slump

With a rusty ass niner lookin' for trouble

<SONGSTART>Hold up
It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital
Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that
There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?"
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen

And I'm bringing this paper faster than

So I'm digging in my mind for the bitches I broke
And keep a player paid in full cause pimping ain't no joke
You want to pop that pussy that's a slim ass chance
Put the paper in the panties when you get that dance
This C.O.D. nigga, so you can keep your nuh plastic cards
No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers
But why slap us when you think a nigga down on his luck
You try and flag us when you see us coming down in a buck
Now what the fuck part of the game taught y'all that bitch play
See we makes a bitch pay

And then a bitch stay
Wouldn't sit still
Fuck how this shit feel

This shit real pimping

And you know that we always blowing herb (blowing herb)
And in the club man you know we stay strapped (stay strapped)
And bitch you know that it ain't about this rap (ain't about this rap)

Fuck me right and suck me tight
And you just might hit the blunt hoe
I don't stunt and blow smoke up your ass baby
But don't be acting all saditty with class baby
You with a nigga such as my self it'll cost you
So pay before a nigga fuck around and be the tosser
Sweet Jones, gripping grain
With all that shit you talk ain't got no bezatine chain
And most of y'all niggaz ain't nothing but tricks
But we sipping lean and breaking bricks
Popping pills, work the wood wheel
Fuck where you're from and fuck how you feel

Niggaz wanna do my dirt
Balling down on Beale Street
Sipping on a pint of syrup
Chopping up the chronic weed
Picking all the fucking seeds
Trying to slow my roll
In my trunk I got them fucking keys
Always riding Chevy things
Shining on them twanky things
Kids I'm a role model
Police I'm a dope man
Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead
Never has it left my mouth
Optimos a fifth of crown
Red eyes with a frown
Niggaz with them gold teeth
Fast talking on the town
Some of us are under cover
Make your baby mama love us
Knot in my right pocket
Left pocket got them rubbers
Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash
I'mma go pimp a bitch
I'mma like wicked witch
Always got to watch your friends
Backstabbers cause a snitch
Now see let me blow your mind the real business in the wind
The main thing fucking up these hoes is their fucking friends
You remember back in day it was niggaz pimping hoes
Take a look around now it be hoes pimping hoes
What the business what the deal man these hoes got me fucked
Make me walk up in the strip and kind of get like buck
Oh you fucking with my cheese oh you fucking with my paper

Nigga talking bout, robbing Chad
Run up on me with that first, will leave you stinking in the grass
If your calico to mask, if you Baptist go to church
See a hoe up in a nigga, gon pull up a skirt
That'll be, some incredible shit
Niggaz scheming on my bezel, on some devilish shit
I been to hell and back, on another level you bitch
Go on try it I'm going live, they gon need a shovel for you bitch
I been stabbed I been shot, went from no fans to being hot
But somehow always fall short, for trying to keep fiddles in my pot
In a dog eat dog world, y'all fellas be chasing girls
When I place myself in history, too hot for a ladder to catch me
But I can't help but to notice, I'm one of the coldest
And I know y'all haters love when I'm locked up, but I won't lose focus
Yeah I wrote this counting down, how many days I got
So lately my gun ain't been hid, it's been displayed a lot
My attitude is fucked up, I don't give a fuck cause I just don't give one
Thinking bout living a life where everything you do right is wrong, mo'fucker I live one
I know niggaz wanna kill me, but I'm still riding pride
Cause the Lord riding with me, and that's the main reason why
Some niggaz win, and some niggaz lose
Some niggaz getting bruised, some always crying to blues
Some niggaz already lost, and ain't gon lose no mo'
Big shoes hoe choose, ain't paying dues no mo'
Everything y'all trying to do, I built a school hoe
Now it's fly to talk country, I made the rules hoe
I was sagging in my khaki's, 'fore Dickies cool
Gangsta Nike's on my feet, our music banging in the streets
The young B.G.'s, really love to thump
Fuck radio and BET, I'm out here bumping in the trunk
For the girls popping pussy, and the boys with the blow
Cadillac'ers and flat-backers, I'm out here repping for it hoe
Can't any man, boy or woman take away my soul
It's a gift given from God, and I'm keeping a tight hold
The world is ugly and cold, trying to make me the same
But I'ma keep it one hundred, when it come to the game
Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up
We keep it click tight, so when niggaz start lurking
In the dark heaters start, anybody start jerking
Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg
A dragging society, don't borrow don't beg
For tomorrow so gon 'head with your pity, I'ma be cool
Kindergardeners was looking up to me, in pre-school
Down with Pimp C fool, and P-A-T the town
Representing it to the fullest, till I'm gone I hold it down
Bun Beater, would never sell you no lie
So if you ask for the truth, I'ma reply to trill niggaz don't die

<SONGSTART>(cocaine cocaine), I'd like to introduce you all to
(cocaine cocaine) UGK, UGK bitch my man Bun B
Pimp C in the house y'all, put your hands together
Big Dick Cheney and Snowy Snow, (cocaine cocaine)
(Pimp C:)
Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggaz, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'ma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose
Cocaine, cocaine
(Bun B:)
They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Columbia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine
(Rick Ross:)
You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
And my yayo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

The trunk poppa, ready to break y'all off somethin' proper
You know I'm a villain so why try?
Fuck a glock, I'm throwin' a glock party, darin' niggas to drive by
I came to smoke a son of a bitch that went for his but didn't pull it
Fast enough and got blasted up with a bullet
I'm snipin', I got you in my scope so what's the use of tryin' to bail?
I'm ready to catch a case but not for yayo, for a murder, mayne
187 ways to rip ya spine out anytime you wanna test
Say you never heard of pain? Wait till I pull my nine out
And empty out a clip in yo chest cavity
Haven't we been known for takin' it
To the sucka muthafuckas that was fakin' it
Makin' it known I gots my chrome in my ride
And I'm fried, PA nigga worldwide from the Westside, fool
Yeah, I'm serious and this is one of three sixteens
Yeah, ya bastards, I'm serious, this is only one of three sixteens
Straight up, I'm serious that was only one of three sixteens
Now check this shit out
It's DJ DMD, back with that funk flowin' lazy
Kinda crazy, never letting niggas fade me, I'm a little fast on the trigga
Niggas, I get my blast on nightly, you don't wanna fight me
Take yo ass on down the block, I keeps my shit cocked
So knock on wood 'cuz shit could get hot
On this spot, some niggas catchin' lead shots
'Cuz ain't no wipin' off these red dots
Now try me if you think I won't bust
Shots to ya dome will leave ya ass in the dust, nigga
'Cuz ain't nobody droppin' bigger hits
I'm makin' tracks upon, track upon, tracks to make these niggas shit
And I'm down with some fa sho, niggas
So tell me how you gon' diss me with a clique full of ho niggas?
You keep yo ass in yo muthafuckin' set
Or take a slug in ya muthafuckin' chest, Reggie
Mark ass nigga, ya punk bitch
I'm serious and this is two of three sixteens
Ya punks, I'm serious, this is two of three sixteens
Punk ass niggas, I'm serious, this was two of three sixteens
Sixteen number three
Some muthafuckas think they can go with me
But most of them niggas just some hoes to me
I got a lotta niggas that's down with me
But too many niggas like to clown with me
They act like they know me but they really don't
They ask me to come kick it but they know I won't
I see they ass in PA, they don't know me
I see they ass in Houston, I'm they homie
But nigga, how it feel to be a ho?
Gettin' yo ass kicked at every muthafuckin' show
Tryin' to be a gangsta but nigga you's a fool
And tryin' to kick it with me, like me and y'all cool
But nigga, let's see if you can with that chrome
I shoulda popped yo ass when you rolled into my home
But bitch niggas steal and G niggas mack
And busta ass niggas gettin' bullets in they back
And that's a muthafuckin' fact
Ya little muthafucka, I'm serious
And that was three of three sixteens
For any niggas that wanna test
Come up and stress these three muthafuckin' sixteens
You can't fuck wit it, fool

So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F*** it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that b**** do you dirty
we'll wipe her a** out and send detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"

She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot

And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack

Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the C-Support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont

Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers couldn't stop the
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last pump

Dump dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up

A long, long way, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, well, I know, I know, I know, yeah
Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin' crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper I gotta do it quick
Thinkin' I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin' wit, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live everyday like it's my muthafuckin' last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'ma die
But if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'ma take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say, "It'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
This world we livin' in man it ain't nuthin' but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya in New York niggas gettin' shot fo bombers
Now they got yo life in the former they in like California
Niggas wit dubs are hydroponic, marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pops died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wished it was twice mayn
I remember bein' eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not givin' a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' to the end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen fo damn near ten
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day you here but the next day you gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
I'm up early 'cuz ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets Peanut holder my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin' shife, so shife back
Can't show no weakness wit these bitches life jacked
Mayn it's a trip where I stay especially for me
Them bitches tryin' to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga down in Florida Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I ain't no liar
My man BoBo jus' lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God why he let these killas live
And take my homeboy's son away
Man if you got kids show 'em you love 'em
'Cuz God jus might call 'em home
'Cuz one day you're here, the next day you're gone
I know, you know, well, well, yeah
La ra la ra, I know, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you're gone
One day you're here, come on

I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pimpin' down the ave you know I'm lookin' tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that
Who's says he's going through a thang
When ya'll ain't never lied
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
When I hurt and try to hate 'cause she knows the thrill is gone
Say man, I stop smokin' with haters back in ninety four
But niggas thinkin' that a sweeps gone get the through my door
And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye to eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight
And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this away
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away
My dead homey momma's tear shit
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 503
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets just keep on gettin' live with me
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin' that
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains
It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to ESG and all the victims of the game
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I'm pimpin' through the ave. tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown, when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuck 'n' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood

<SONGSTART>Hi life
We livin' that hi life
Hi life
We livin' that hi life
I'm tired livin' f**ked up, tired of livin' bad
Tired of grandmama telling me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm tryin to live up to the image
That she would want me to be
But I got one foot in the street and every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G but Niggas depend on me
It ain't fake to hit a 10 so niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushing cocaine niggas holding pistols
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20, 000 tryin' to turn it into a hundred, and ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas came to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch thinking she can ease my mind by suckin' my dick
Bitch make up for a minute cause that ship never last
In 1996 niggas is dyin' from layin' on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Easy-E died
And you be wonderin' why you niggas
Out there smokin'cri
I wish that I could tell y'aIl wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that nigga you know that I would be lyin'
And I been f**kin' pussy since the tender age of nine
It's gettin' to be a full-time job just tryin' to stay alive
And crack a scandalous smirk offended by the weed
Smoke comin' of my shirt
But I still put in work and front for my folks
'cause where I come from nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe
Some say that nigga's sellin' dope
And you know I ain't lyin' that just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the devil poke you
With his fork
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophet, f**kin' hoes
And gettin' paid
I'm looking for that
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life
You only got one life to live that's all they give us to do it
You could bullshit your way through it or stay true
It can be complicated cause niggas
Be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the people
In the lane get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive, take your positions
With pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dust
To see the only stretch rest see how we was left to be
Down these streets that we be on
Motherf**kers sleepin' on them corners that you be on
Probably because society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the f**k made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas sellin' that dank
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of the American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on who gives a damn
When you can't afford a turkey or ham
Livin' off of Ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab, it's far from me
To push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your man
And so instead of being without I'm hustlin' tryin' to
Get through these ungodly days
Thinkin' of ways to get the f**k out of this maze
A man'll commit a crime who the& f**k it crime pays
I'm goin' through a phase you don't go out until you
Out reason a motherf**ker
Gots to pour out this 40 on the curb, disturbed and
Left with no doubt in this mind
But still sometimes he don't know why he walkin' around just hopin'
He can get one more try to make it
It's a bullshit he goin' through but yo he gots,
You can't fake it to get the
Hi life (Hi life)
We livin' that hi life
Hi life (hi life)
We livin' that hi life

Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby
(Hook - x2)
(Bun B)
It's the tough boy, boulevard niggas, rollin around tan up
All four corners on your block fool, nuttin but that bunny hop
happenin, high gassin, daily routine, my load is plush
Interior crush and fool I'm through clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
in your soul so letta player take control
And do what the hell ya been waitin
to see and that's me rollin on three Dayton's
Wit one of them thangs in the air, it's hangin up there
Shinin steel fat man, but I don't care if everybody sit back and stare
Everywhere we go they linin up as if we're startin up a parade
And everybody thinkin they get paid
But I don't really give a damn, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
on a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right
(Pimp C) Never let broke gold diggers ride
Never let broke gold diggers ride
Never let broke gold diggers ride
"Got front and back, and side to side"
Never let broke gold diggers ride
"Got front and back, and side to side"
"Got front and back, and side to side"
Never let broke gold diggers ride

<SONGSTART>Dear Lord, I know You don't condone
The things I be doin' out here in these streets
And I hope that, I pray that You can overlook
The wrong that I had done in my life
I don't know no other way to survive out here
I got a whole bunch of people dependin' on me
Just walk with me, walk with me
Busslin' and gamblin', hit licks scramblin'
Bricks, I'm out here handlin', I'm pimpin' and I'm payin' the rent
Didn't choose this dirty game, this dirty game, it chose me
Every city love cocaine, they'll get it from him
If they don't get it from me
So I get cross-country with that thang
Makin' that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin' that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
'Cause I put up sum from every sale so all my children can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell
But just put me in woodgrain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that sweet down 'cause that bullshit don't apply to me
'Cause out here on the real streets a dreamer always stay sleep
'Cause out here the strong survive
And now they didn't die from thankin' weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it hard, still tryna get right with God
Still read my Bible lone 'cause Reverend do wrong, still livin' fraud
Tonight if I get down on my knees
And ask the Lord to forgive me, please
You thank He gon' hear me?
'Cause tomorrow I'm still gon' be slangin' ki's
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
See, I was born in the ghetto, manye, I was raised in the hood
And unless you lived it yourself, it just can't be understood
People think hustlin' is cool or hustlin' is live
They don't understand hustlers only hustlin' to survive
They wished they lived in the 'burbs, wished they didn't have to hang
Out on corners in low-income house in projects and slang
They wish their daddy was home, mama wasn't on drugs
And they didn't have to grow up to be dealers and thugs
Po' children got aspirations and dreams just like the wealthy
But it's hard when that environment you live in ain't healthy
You ain't givin' no hope, nobody showin' you pride
And you live with all this anger and frustration inside
Dog, don't let nobody tell you what you can or you can't do
Just 'cause they funky ass couldn't do it, they ain't you
You can be who you wanna be, live life how you feel
Just put your faith in the Lord, now that's keepin' it trill fo' real
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's
For all the niggaz in the game that's been slangin' cheese
For all them boys on them swangers and their fifth wheel
I'm out here riskin' my life, niggaz shife but I stay trill
I pray so much, I wonder if the Lord love me
I think He do but I'm so caught up in my thug deep
The feds bug me, followin' me around for three
Niggaz couldn't catch me so they hit me with conspiracy
You know that that's the other level of the game
Ain't got shit on me but some niggaz said my name
So here they come, they thang tight
They playin' shife, no Bun, givin' me life
I ain't goin' back, I'm a make 'em kill me
I'ma bust back, fuck the pen, you feel me?
Wish I can hug my momma and kiss my baby girl
I know it's a better place than livin' in this dirty world
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Some people win and some people lose
Some always cryin' the blues, yeah
Some people win, some people lose
Some always bein' misused
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
'Cause I need You, Lord, right now
I need You, right now
Need Ya, I need Ya, I need Ya
I need Ya 'cause I'm goin' and livin' too fast, yeah
Lord, I'm just a G
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
I just can't give it up
I'm riskin' all out in the streets
Out here livin' fast
How long can it last?
Out here livin' too fast, how long can it last?
I can't get up, Lord, can You help me?
Lord, can You help me? Can You help me?
Can You help me, right now, yeah

I put it down on that gulf bank but now i reside on that south beach
And im hustlin on the grind 72
Hours straight
No time to eat or sleep im slangin' licks and that just won't wait
Im campaignin for a new Benz
On the rims with bubble lenz
Im stackin' every dollar i see 100s 50s 20s and 10s
Doors open doors close never sweat hoes playas get yo's
Hustle and flow cars clothes thats the playa like that i know
Roll the dank up where the dro?
Pour the drank up where the fo's
Stackin money all on the low and we still ridin dirty
Got a drop top on them rollerskates
Candy jolly rancher paint
Enjoyin the spoils of hard work and grind more tryin to get bank
I dont know what them boys thinkin my motivation is benjamin franklin
Im tryin to maintain this wealth that i been calculatin
Gettin money thats all i know
On my toes never off my note
Woodgrain and hundred spokes i wave the trunk just like a pro
I grind its off to work i go I hustle hard its no stop
And if i flop i switch to hustle
I learned the game then set up shop
Im strivin' to make it to the top
Its all or nothin no turnin back
Im with them boys out on the block
Accumulating them paper stacks
Im makin money this where its at
Whatever it takes crack or jack
In love with my money and thats a fact
And we STILL RIDIN' DIRTY
Right now we got the 5th wheel reclinin
Trunk popped up screens fallin from the sky
Candy paint sprayed by eddie and im ridin on that glassy chrome
all courtesy of my hustle game
Real hustlin's in my blood line
I dont complain or whine
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make
a dime I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind but now i see that road to riches
Its a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs
I peep game from the best and since then i been playin chess
I put in work with no rest
To get that paper thats my quest
Im on the slow grind towards success
One of the best 'cause i keep it fresh
Im one hundred isnt nothin less
And im STILL RIDIN' DIRTY

<SONGSTART>Gawd-DAYUM! I don't know what y'all been thinkin bout
But I think this right here is about to shut dem damn haters down!
I'm from the streets that make niggaz walk slow talk low
With white chalk-o, mi casa be siete uno ocho
Brooklyn motherfucker, handle this - pardon my Spanish and French (Brooklyn baby!)
Okay, I stay clever like Mayweather with lay leather
'til your face sever, one of the greatest ever
Beyond ringing bells, my name's so demanding
Shit! - I got the swagger that'll leave Dakota "Fanning" (That boy still standing!)
I hope you niggaz over standing; I stay sucker-free
The next kaing of in the game, you ain't got enough to be
Your career last a week, that'll be luckily
Fuck with me, the rap game'll need protective custody
(AHH!) I'm the same thug to be, surrounded with women
Gave the game "True Religion" before you found it in denim
Feel the, "Wrath of Kane, " and you could not escape
The hip-hop version of "The Ring" and you just watched the tape (Next up!)
And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We Trill workin the wheel, understand nigga? (UNDERSTAND?)
I smother and split a bitch down to the tendon
High pressure, if you don't break your ass bendin
I'm way past endin in my series of warnin
You flex with me tonight playa you dead by the mornin (Woo!)
Bun Beater the best ever breathin or deceased
From the South to Midwest, Cali to the East
Got to any city nigga and bring my name up (all o'em!)
I bet I eat the best rapper they got in the game up
Call a nigga up, email him or chirp him
Make a meal out his motherfuckin ass and then burp him
(DAYUM!) Don't fuck around I'm not your lil' homey
I'm the king of the underground so act like you know me (Next up!)
Feel me...
Homie, we big steppin, big reppin
We givin kids Smith & Wesson's lessons, you get left with a sketchin
Left with the Midwest, clique Texans (who dat?)
G. and Daddy Kane, the click Texas, (word) pop you to death
I put private planes on swift Jetsons, niggaz know what it is
When you see the ball cap and a slick Thessons (woo!)
(Aight) Til you strip vexing to a movie clip from the Westerns
Shit from the Uzi clip lift up your midsection (Tell em G. Rap)
He will introduce you to the nose on the Glock fam
Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band (rock band!)
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man (AOOOW!)
High roller dose some hoes on the cock plan
Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin cheese til the rubberbands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em "Hot Pants" (Next up!)
I make your girl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt
I'm a young hot street flame (Flame)
They call me Sweet James, or call me Sir Jones
Two hundred dollar cologne
(Uh!) Board Nine, or Issey Miyaki
I got your girl mine, meat strong like saki
I ain't Rocky but I keep her rockin
Fuck around I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket
Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin watchin my top fall in
On my Lambourghini with the quick scream
Fettucini, linguini, shrimp and a bowl of lean!
What you know about gettin cross country
Nigga your piece big but your diamond look monkey
You need to take that shit back

Now, damn somebody need to beat Jacob's ass over that!

A little sly delight, I done pushed my pride aside
Just to slide inside, man I done died tonight
Now what I'm 'sposed to do? Been got close to you
Lookin like a poster to, don't wanna boast but you Missus
Do a Dr. Feel good, lay a playa real good
Limpin came back, and it was still good, she will
Put a few tips in her mouth, that's that definition
Of them true chicks in the South, let me do my thang
On the cool quick to the crotch, get the beds but guess what?
We kickin them hot, shakin it soft, should a been here

But now the chicks they call me James Jones
And if I skip I'm back to D-slangin, keep them boys nod-headed
Keep the boppers with they butts swangin

Now I leave them gulls with they jellyroll swollen, I'm rollin

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

But the homies all think that I'm losin' my mind

'Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin' my car
And everyday it get better, I can't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin' she ain't nothin' but a scrub
But she make me feel high like I'm hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I can't help myself, I know that I'm trippin'
But she got it goin' on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my credit card
You know she get it 'cause ya know that
(Chill, C)
I know, G, I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin' pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin' aw'll limp
Why I let her play me? You can't understand

I, yi, yi, yi, I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin' used
Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and still ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin' good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin' out them duckets and them, croka sacks
And everybody wonderin' why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, ask me why I wanna dis her
I told her 'cause her lovin' ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin' out and Byrd say I'm trippin' too
But this time I just can't listen to my whole crew
'Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But ninety two came around and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man
I, yi, yi, yi, I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin' me

Oh, you can just keep usin' me
Until you use me up
To sum it all up, I'm breakin' all my rules
'Cause she got me droppin' off her little brother to school
I be gettin' bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on sex
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food

Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boyz, that's why we act this way

Hopin' these niggas don't blast today
Pro smoke, pro choke, anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' in criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality, unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats, and gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble, write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take it, trick, I fake it, blink 'n poof

All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em or what the fuck we sell 'em

Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke when my trunk steady hummin'

(Nigga, I'm so real)
Bitch, how you feel? Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel
Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play, it don't change, ain't a thang to say
It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go
Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers, body rockers
Late night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerrilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us
Touched like Midas, these bitch ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch ass niggas ain't got no cheese?
Blowin' big kill
(Blowin' big kill)
Million dollar deals
(Million dollar deals)
Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Uh, puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J
Smoke somethin', bitch

<SONGSTART>Well it's big Bun Beeda I built the track

It ain't nowhere fans a bunch with these sluts
Just shake your butts and bring back that stack (stack)
The mack is back and he's sittin on chrome
with a piece of chain or Herringbone or nugget (nugget)
That don't mean him a real live hoe
You ain't ready to roll then go on then, fuck it
Out them ducats, hoes better recognize
Niggaz better recollect, Bun finna regulate
I hit yo' town (what) find me a hoe stroll
Leave that bitch dry and head to another state (hold up)
Me and my brother can't wait when it come to the red
Cause we about that cash, cash
So if we can't convince ya we'll take your sister
Hit the highway and mash
You got, bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got, bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got, bitches that can and you got bitches that cain't
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch
Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care
I like the girl with the pussy hair
My partner Mike Mo like the pussy bare
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swang Big Dick, swang Sweet Jones
Go and get the myth out the cobra head
Girl got down you niggaz scared
I got a young yellow bitch, I'ma sing it loud
With a four-inch corner of jet-mink hair
Between her legs is where it great
And get the money out the nigga when she go on a date
I stay caked up, rocked up
Magnum rubbers stay socked up
I ain't tryin to get the wet dick
Hold my good but she ain't that slick
I know you want this high-dollar cum
Bitch know I got money, wanna get her some
Bitch you must, done lost your mind
The trick's niggaz over there, you better get on the grind
Bitches not flexin ain't much good
I should and I would keep clear if I could
But when I do I just CAWN'T get away
Cause I gotta fuck all day every day
That leaves me run loco for real
All these chickenheads lie about deal
Ain't gotta do it up to make me chill
Find a good spot on the floor and kneel!
Know that my heart's in between my fires
Though I can't take when they look in my eyes
Lookin for love that's no surprise
Comin up off, that's family ties
Then I hit it from the back, all the way
Slap that back and just lock cross say
Not freeze out without no delay
Girls in the chat, I ain't got shit to say

It's all about the candy paint, it's all about the Vogues
It's all about the slab, baby, it's all about the hoes
Got some cars and some pros some real and some fraud
Hated on by a nigga, hated on by a broad

And that nigga that you live with ain't like me
Ain't from Atlanta but I know these hoes like me
They pulling on my zipper wanna bite me
I got a bitch from Oakland like to get hyphe
In the bed with her head in a jib
Eating on my dick like it's some corn or a barbeque rib
Drop it to the floor, let me fuck with you

Shake it slow, to and fro, back and forth, up and down

Real stuck on that backside, it's looking kind of right
With the juicy tank top and a loop of ten heels
All bullshit aside, she looking ready to kill
But when I say kill, I mean murder the cock
I'm talking beating the pussy up while the headboards knock
She ain't watching the clock, ain't finna answer the phone

Put your feet in the sky, bring your knees to your chest
Grab a hold to the sheets, bitch, and I'ma do the rest
Get to pressing on your pink, gripping on your soft
To the side, take a ride, from the back I break you off
I want some pussy and some navel and some ass and some mouth
I ain't fucking for me bitch, I'm fucking for the whole south
Show me what you working with, bitch, what you got?

Bring it bad lifestyle, Coming down
Like Distilled liquid Bottled In confusion
You know I got a sickness, Coming down
With three Rap Album of the years
And no Album of the year given
Honestly, Screw the Grammies
I feel directed by this Sam Raimi
But this Spiderman ain't too happy
Where's my Mary Jane Watson
Where my options, Quit my job
Quit loven her, leave college, no, quit stopping
Comin down the walls, used to
Be afraid to fall, cause Life is
About picking yourself up
Coming down like an angel
No one on this Earth is hear to save you
Comin down like 100 percent
Fresh from head to toe, like
They still eat you up like
You're a rotten tomato
Comin down like you're a spider
You got talent why hide her

Takes a lot to be a man

It's two wrongs on this track
Take the weight off my back
Remember don't blow my day
I'm a heart attack, Cohesive
Some mean shit, I just don't talk cold
I mean shit Comin down like Denzel in the Hurricane
Feel like they're starting fires
And igniting flames, anything
To take down No Came down
Taken for a conviction of triple
Murder, Rubin Carter's life was murdered,
Just like a black man criticized for controversy
Sometimes I start my own, most lies do hurt me
Coming down like a homicide victim,
Just cause I look and sound different
Comin down like James Bond, I'm on another
Mission 005.7 like the rate of homicide victims
Violent crimes are hard to retire, they never Will
I am fucking legend even if I am killed
I'm still that potion, to put haters
In to the motion, Say I'm the reason
For most to believe in, Let's say I'm everything
And there's nothing in between me, I'm
Still the muthafucking shit

I know two things
I know nothing
I still can't muthafucking quit
West 3
Comin up, all I wanted to
Be in high school was a jock
A homecoming king, a volley-
Ball player, a boxer, a rockstar, a Rodney King
But no rapper has me beat
An actor, a rocker, a baseball
Player, a professional wrestler
Similar to Brock Lesnar
Even a ladies man, a bodybuilder
Once again a boxer, a skilled dribbler
A debater, snowboarder
A triathlete, a break dancer
Now I hate dancing, a wake boarder
Even a cheerleader, more like
A peer mediator, Who am I
Where's my first breath
Took profound leaps in every step,
I was even into football, ob course
Basketball, bring it soccer, even tennis
Can't stop winning, it's addictive
Life is a game board until you finish it
Even a lifeguard, but I still can't swim
I know everything
I know two things
I know three things
I still can't muthafucking quit

Coming down, once in
A while, you get good shoes now
Comin down with disappointment
Life is a deadly appointment
But it's important, know that's true
What's the difference between me and you
Comin down with the major talk
What am I going to do after college
Before I graduate, bring it Morgan
State, Comin down like
Bobby Brown
Last name a color and a noun
I have to cool it now
But I never will
When the world is hotter than Mills
And I'm not talking Texas County
I'm talking I will punish you
If you befoul me
Start a riot, if you lying

<SONGSTART>So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F**k it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C:)
Sweet jones
My bitch a choosey lover, never f**k without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like the f**k for 40 dollars in the club
f**king up the game, bitch you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, Im pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Bun B:)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that aint my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B U N B
Cause what's a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoes?
Dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get jones
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi:)
Eni mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I dont do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
Thats like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-saw pole
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
(Chopped & Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b**** is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
(Chopped & Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, walk it off from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooh ooh
I choose you girl
I, I choose you baby

I got that green monster baby, can you buy that?
Plus I got Swisha suit for days, you wanna try that?
I roll them, most of them big and fat they look like ball bats
I live in P A T, the East side, niggas sayin' jack
These laws be trippin' 'cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it in cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living a Mac
And I ain't trippin', flippin' then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
'Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho but ho, I'll break ya knees

Don't want no pussy, homosexual, on the low nigga
That's y'all (that's y'all), I from the old school (uh!)

I know Short Dog (Dog), the real Short Dog (Dog)
Who see me drapin drips, stepped out the whip on Sunset Strip
(Pimp C)
Swishas and dosha, blow when we driving
Benz's and Cadi's, swangin big bodies
Swishas and dosha, blow when we driving
Benz's and Cadi's, swangin big bodies
Swishas and dosha
(Bun B)
F**k niggaz bumpin gums, real niggaz be bumpin screw (screw)
So don't get bumped up, just in case a real G bump into you
I'm like Bumpy Knuckles, buck with nothin but ready rockers
that's down for pistol play (on who?), on boy's that's steady knockers
Got boppers that's steady jockin, goofy niggaz in my ear
Bitch I'ma self-made trillionaire, get your soft ass outta here
Weak niggaz wanna plead their case (case), just to raise up out my face (face)
I ain't got that time to waste, punch your mouth and knock out the taste
You MySpacin and Facebookin, playin games with them toys
I'm in the streets where gangstas meet, while you're online with them boys
So step your game up, build your name up, quit your talkin and quit your doin
All that planning and contemplating. when the f**k you gon' start pursuing?
Cars ain't driving themselves, mansions ain't building themselves
They waiting for Annie Mae and they need to stop feelin themselves
They wealth ain't comin until they earn it
But that somethin they won't know 'til they learn it, while burnin...
(Pimp C)
I'ma tell you pussy niggaz once again (once again)
Ain't had no friends since I left the pen (uh!)
It's some niggaz I respect in the rap game (game)
But it's some niggaz that I better not hear sayin my f**kin name (uh!)
You say I love a stripper (bitch!), pullin down my zipper (bitch!)
That hoe was payin me, bitch don't try to play with me! (bitch!)

You gotta problem with me, go to Lil J with it
(Bun B)
This is UGK, get it? Bun and Pimp, Pimp and Bun

Trill ass niggaz certified, ain't never been no wanna-be (naw)
Has-been's, Never-was, Past-due, Out-dated
Can't nobody from the North, East, West, or South fade it (at all)
You talkin down but we comin up as well as comin down
So Pimp sum it up baby

<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Uhhhhhhhh ~!
If you know like I know you would get down on the flo'
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisha full of 'dro
We can get down for my dime and we can f**k, on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha f**kin with me fo'?
Every lady ain't a hoe and every hoe ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't f**k around with no punks
Ride with me she holdin a pistol while I'm whippin and poppin the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems 'long as she hear what the f**k I said
Pimpin ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here livin by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm lookin at you you choosin me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm superstar, we headed to the top
(Chorus: sung)
I'm stayin true, I'm out here whippin my Mercedes
F**kin with the midnight ladies - the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm bangin Screwwww, my young girl lookin fine
We stayin out here on the grind - and keepin money on our mi-ii-iind
(Bun B:)
Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, gotta feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster-ass persona so hard it can dent, steel
In the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leakin fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust

Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leakin out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you gotta go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Gotta pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Gotta play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's yo' turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a f**k how you feel
(Chorus)
(Pimp C:)
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the SOOOOOOOOOUTH
This scary hoe don't wanna know what it's ABOOOOOOOOUT
Cause I stay country true down to the co', dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws, feel it tighten up don't stop don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars, f**k the D.A. f**k the law
I f**k the snow but I love a pro like flatbackers I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer, drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker, bitch around me man I'ma mack her
(Bun B:)
From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of 'dro and Impala bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki', and ten kilos grams in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's one point five mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is tickin, time is pressin
No second guessin, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK
(Chorus)
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S H O R T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be living naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell
I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fucking maker
'Cause I ain't taking, no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts
Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch
This dope ain't yo dope and these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafucking guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafucking road
And don't even try to come back nigga, yo
'Cause me Dre and C got fingers on a fat trigger
We making too much money moving weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper booming cold blow yo ass up
And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailing on yo bitch ass
But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas
Niggaz on the track dropping shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cooking up some llello for the local drug king
The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slanging some more white dust
Real, oh, so trill, the life's no glamor
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fucking up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home
And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales
Stupid muthafuckas smoking dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fighting Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops finding my stash, yo what could the worst be
Through so going undercover then turning dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Calling my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas
I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't 'bout to sell no fucking dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope but you still ain't selling shit
Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon' let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafucking cuts
So step in like I said before, we'll take them muthafucking nuts
Ask the last nigga brought his fucking ass down
Trying to sell that fucking dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'm a go to Port Arthur and run them fucking niggaz
Brought his fucking gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac
Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope
Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
'Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafucking killas
So have your shit attached, before you come check us
Pimp C, bitch, P.A. home, Short Texas

Underground Kingz for life, young Pimp C
Put my first record out, at the age of 16
Rapping 'bout moving work, candy painted symphony
We was the first niggaz, talking 'bout wood wheel
Made up the word, that's why I'm so trill
Now everybody, wanna bite my swagger
Roll like a stone, like my name Mick Jagger
Say it befo', had to tell you hoes again
Run a drum machine, like my name Roger Men
Write the rhyme do the beat, the hook and the mix

The Pimp and the Bun, Bobby U.N. and J.R.

Fuck the fame want the change, it's been fun

UHH...
Dedicated to all the underdogs, knahmtalkinbout?
Muthafuckas told me I wasn't gon be shit...
Told me I was gon be able to do this rap shit...
Knahmtalkinbout? My own family talked down on me, knahmsayin?
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (My uncle told me I wasn't gon be shit)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (I used to walk around with a bag full of rappers)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
(Motherfucker told me, a nigga from Texas couldn't make no record)
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
(Then after I made the record, muh'fuckers said they would never give us no respect)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... (But now they tryna rap like us)
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah... (Tryna be like us, tryna smell like us)
(Knahmtalkinbout?)
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money... (Check this out)
[Pimp C:]
Man I refuse to let the bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up, but they cain't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a hoe open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a hoe for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
(right... right...)
[Chorus:]
You cain't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (hmm...)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (hmm...)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh...
But all you got to do is believe...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho...
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah...
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money...
[Pimp C:]
To all the babies havin babies on ya' own
I know you feelin fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, "Ya fucked up your life"
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy with lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggaz tellin you, "Ya crazy"
"What you thankin? You too young to have a family"
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggaz ain't gon ride witchu
But get down with that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin
It's time to change sumthin...
[Chorus]
[Pimp C:]
If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, "It ain't enough room in the NBA"
You tell them haters, "Save that bullshit for another day"
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, "You ain't gon make it", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase to hog it up, the lawyer end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be shame and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right...
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
... (Uh!)

Turnin' whores to carnivores, they just can't leave my meat alone
It's been a long time since I busted on a glock
But every corner that I hit, I left it screwed up and chopped
Marooned up and dropped, like my Biarritz on top
Let the motherfucker bleed until it drip and let it drop
I'm still that young boy that had a pocket full of stones

Lay down the competition, take their cash crops and get my push on

And we don't bar no plexes, we way bigger than other men though
The diamond deuces on tinted windows, we in the wind yo
We 'Chevro way' the wind blow, that's the corner we been Joe
Don't know where you been bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though
When it's ten fo', good, but in my Styrofoam good and muddy
We block bleeders, leavin' your neighborhoods good and bloody
We grippin' that woodler, bud it, sit back and scope it
Pay attention to Prince and pushin' everything about to pump it

A Phantom Rolls Royce, 24's with the bump
I ain't trippin' about the seat, I got them woofers in my trunk
Cut in my swisher, codeine on my whiskers
Fuckin' with that Smoke D, Bundy and that Vicious
UGK Records, it's an institution
Know a lot of niggaz livin' off of prostitution
Pimpin' ain't dead, it just moved to the web
Bitch ain't gotta hit the track, ain't gotta give no tricks no head
Ain't got to give no tricks, no pussy, just cameras and screams
Easiest money you can get, it's the American Dream bitch
Man I'm a middle finger figure, a million dollar mission
Poppin' like Orville Redenbacher, with a whippin' in the kitchen

Get to stickin but make sure you cut us deep
'Cause I betcha we comin' back a couple hundred brothers deep
Pimp and Bun, we run the streets, which streets? Man, pick your hood
Don't matter, we represented, cross us? We gon' get you good

Ay C keep yo' eyes open for the boppers, car hoppers
Daisy Dukes out on the block, showin cock, traffic stoppers
Lookin good spendin some nigga G's
Nails by Vietnamese, [unverified], lookin' like they worth G's
Dress above they knees, jellies and G-strings up the ass
Man I never let 'em pass
So, tell me where can I find 'em
With they nigga or in that candy Cadillac right behind him
Bitches tellin' me see yo' dick grand
All she wanna do is ride Su-bur-ban
Put her ass on the leather and rub the wood
See we got boppers in Texas oh, man that pussy look good
So, I let them hoes ride and I show them a grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
When she told me I looked good I didn't feel no pride
All the bitch wanted to do is just fuck my ride
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car

Assumin' that they body's too boomin to dispute
But pussy is the root of all drama
An attribute put up in they head by they momma
Oh yeah, I'ma tell it like it is, I sees how it goes down
Niggaz talkin' 'bout, how they passin' these hoes 'round
But y'all trickin', them hoes told me
Fools y'all ain't Goldy, ridin' in a goodie but an oldie
Fifty dollars there, a hundred dollars here
You brought the bitch a drink and all her homegirls a beer
Your homeboys lookin for ya, but yo' ass gone
You left your niggaz at the club and took all them hoes home
And didn't even fuck, man what the fuck
If you didn't want to fuck then get the fuck up out the truck
You know what I mean? I ain't showin out Vogues
Just so these hoes can be seen, c'mon you wanna fuck or cut?
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
When you look at my chrome and you lick your lips
It's just like I'm rubbin' my dick between your hips
And when you smile and shake your ass, my grill smile right back
Bitch I'm the real, that's why I ride Cadillac
And I'ma fuck you and fuck all yo' friends
Soon as Pimp C come through in that 600 Benz
With burgundy paint, butter and LG rims
Color TV, VCR playin X-rated films
Of myself, runnin up in beauty queens
But let me tell y'all niggaz the difference between y'all and me
You see, man I can tell all that bitch wanted to do
Is just ride for free and smoke for free
But bitch not me, you better ask them hoes if my name Pimp C
Unless your pussy makin ten thousand dollars a week
The only way I see you sittin in my passenger seat, you bitch!
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
Look a nigga up and down like he a superstar
But they ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
Now bitches stare a nigga down when he step to the bar
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
Look a nigga up and down like he a superstar
But they ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
But bitch who the fuck you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car

Verse 1 (pimp c):
I'm coming down candy, i put in my work
got a $10, 000 link medalion hangin' on a $2000 shirt
the game's been good
and all the hoes wanna sit on leather and the wood
bitches tryin' to price my diamonds
but that shit is just so common
'cause they see a nigga shinin'
but i'm movin' too fast
96 karats if you think that you could manage
got the drink and the salad
now the bitch is on the?
i'm comin' down gulf way, i'm tryin' to see what's up
i see big ass and some titties
now we flippin' in the 'bourbon to the city
the attitude's shitty but i bought no plex
ain't talkin' 'bout the malcolm but i'm ridin' on the x
the highway was so wet, i'm slippin' out my lane
the bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
i bet you never seen a big truck like that
i bet you never got a dick sucked like that
the bitch didn't know that i was tapin' the whole scene
now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen
the glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
i got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
tryin' to close me down, but i got ghetto love
i'm pimp c bitch, i'm comin' down richer than rich
so bitch you know you gotta gimme good stuff
Chorus:
Lookin' for that good stuff
ba ba ba ba da da da
tighten up on that backstroke
ba ba ba ba da da da
lookin' for that good stuff
tighten up on that backstroke
comin' down on fresh paint
blowin' swisher sweet smoke
Verse 2 (bun-b):
We flippin' worldwide, p.a.t. international jetsetters
bigger than the hollywood letters
but don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
breakin' off the jealous with pitch black barettas
my fellas and tellers who holdin' plates against them texas boys
bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex
like you major boy you have done played yourself
too $hort smoked you like a newport, and you bought
a one-way ticket to something bigger than you
over your head and got scared
exactly what i figured you'd do
now who you kiddin', i'm slangin', bangin', and skiddin'
busta playa moves and if you done it and did it
as i sit in the lap of luxury
dea is tryin' to stick bugs to me
undercover motherfucker tried to sell drugs to me
what could be more throw
mafioso puttin' bombs under my load
never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
now i'm comin' down shinin'
pieces and chains full of diamonds
i'm winin' and dinin' and caligula
pretty boys gettin' off the hook
bitches sayin' but i'm diggin' ya
but i know that make ya mega crunk
and make ya make it man it make a niggas wanna pop trunk
got skunk from the rasta, eatin' steak and lobster
like a mobster and gots to be lookin' for the good stuff
Chorus

<SONGSTART>Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
[Chorus:]
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin-swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
[Pimp C:]
When the top starts fallin the bitches start callin
My trunk start bangin and the fo's start crawlin
The drank mixed up, in the cream soda bottle
Her lips, hit my dick that's why I smashed on the throttle
Swisha Sweet candy, Robert Davis in my cup
I'm swervin like Bootsy but I couldn't give a fuck (fuck)
You see this car? (You see this car?)
You see this truck? (You see this truck?)
They both for me now watch them girls get buck (buck)
Ain't shit friendly but we still have fun (fun)
UGK for life, you know the Pimp and the Bun (Bun)
The great state of Texas, candy in the Lexus
Dick for them hoes jaws, pistols for the flexers
Somebody asked me why I'm ridin on the East
All I did was told the truth, the bullshit niggaz cease (cease)
If you ain't hatin nigga why the fuck you mad?
If your records ain't sellin, get your fingers out ya ass, bitch!
[Chorus]
[Bun B:]
Well it's the king of the trill (trill) wood wheel in my palm (palm)
Yeah I'm sittin sideways on suedes smokin that bomb (bomb)
The granddaddy kush mixed with a little O.G. (fo' sho')
That's my breakfast, off top I gotta blow three
Not to mention codeine, liquid and the pill (pill)
Bloats on my grill with my hand on my steel (steel)
Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing
I'ma gon' and pop the trunk, surely but slowly
Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your Colby Jet system (no)
Your slab ain't holdin, ain't no use to you frontin
And I'm fin' to shut the game down when I push the button
And the... [echoes]
[Chorus]
[Cory Mo:]
Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang
Cory Mo about to do the damn thaaaaang
In the butter guts with the diamond in the back
King Kongs in the trunk, hit the switch and watch it crack
I'ma let my paper stack and quote nothin but facts
So don't "ax" me nothin partner 'less you droppin some cash (cash)
Now she hoppin it fast (fast) that's just how I like it (like it)
Turn around and show me somethin girl I'm gettin excited (oooh)
Ain't nobody trippin cause the money already made
I done said it befo', so I'ma say it again
And let my top drop dowwwwwn
[Chorus]
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>It all started with a Pimp C, bitch
So what the fuck is up?
Told 'em somethin' good
Ease up my muthafuckin' cut
'Cause if you don't really wanna fuck wit a trill nigga
From the trill villa wit a steel trigga land of the real killers
Pop pop muthafucka there you go
I'ma bust 'em on yo ass if you don't ease up off me ho
'Cause trill niggas don't carry no sugar in they nutsac
Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack
So you gon' give me my money but you don't hear me though
But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes
P.A. nigga, trill ass nigga
How you figga you can buck me down nigga?
Mr. big an, Mr. big time, give me what's mine
Instead of buying cars for a bitch named sunshine
Give me what's mine, give me what's mine
Before it come down to triggas
Shit, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Bitch, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
Uh, it's the return of the trill ass niggas
But you can't hear me
It's the return of the trill ass niggas bitch
Yea muthfuckas, I figured you run
I figured you run, when I pull triggas to guns
That triggas to guns P.A. fool a nigga named Bun
A nigga named Bun, no more sun, no more shine
Say hello to the nine milly millameter
(Buck, buck, buck)
Money tight glock, bustin' them shots
When I break yo ass off somethin' hot
Niggas steady catchin' lead to the head
I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin' bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin', niggas start passin' away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise, I'm gettin' Chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now it's the return of the trill ass niggas

Frontline comin' down on twenty four inches
Dope boys hangin' on the corners and the benches
Sayin' it's a drout so it's plenty of heat pinches
Boy, used to come up from the rags to the riches
Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches
But now it's like the game is full of nothin' but some snitches
And wanna be gangsters that's scared to put 'em in ditches
Fed's takin' pictures so the cameras go click
And video rollin' while I'm holdin' my dick
They follow me around like they doin' they job
But while you watchin' me how many people gettin' robbed
Lets keep it trill 'cause we already know
What it already is and how it already go
That's why we chop blades comin' down real slow
Pop trunks, swang, riders slam Cadillac door
Pass the swisha let's blow
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Don't wanna be disturbed, I got my swishas & erb
Before we get started, every body roll up one for Pimp C
Before we go any further, take your lighter, light it up for me
Now let's go, now let's go and all the girls get down on the floor
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
Throw your money in the air and let 'em know
I'm whippin' big wheels, whippin' big wheels
Hope your drink don't spill whippin' big wheels
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel
lady on my side, hey
And if you all down for me
Put your hands in the air raise 'em up for Pimp C
And if you all down with me

He ain't teachin you nothin, you need to learn me
Check out my mind, I'm 24 on the grind

And I don't get caught up in "he say, she say"
And I don't chase the cat, I keep the P play

Still I fits, out, cause she thick, stout
With the feminine fat, in all the right places
She look me in my eyes and she make all the right faces
Cause she's a real catch, we make a tough pair
A true dynamic duo and we up there
We sittin tall at the top
And if she ride or die for me playa I'm a give her all that I got
I break her off and not, let her hold the keys
I don't take her out of town, man I take her oas
It ain't trickin if you spend it on your lady
Bring the bacon home to baby and everything'll be gravy
Just let me know if that's soundin like a plan
Cause all you really need to change your life is the man
And you appealin to the King of the Trill and

PA is the town, where it's goin' down, West side to the East it's off the chain
I'm bangin' my surround, swangin' on these clowns, candy paint is drippin' leavin' stains
You see the diamonds grippin' on the grain, chrom-ed lady sittin' on the grill
Leanin' down the fifth, smokin' on the fiff, drop the top and let em' see the trill
UGK 4 Life, you better ask your wife, she'll tell you Bun and Pimp the real
Like Mack the Knife so if you actin' shife then Imma give you somethin' you can feel
Don't make me have to go and pull the steel

And put one in your dome, cuz I be puttin' on for my city

[Bun B]
A bad day for the niggaz in my click
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It's seems the drug situation is so tow up
And poes down the fuckin T-X had to show up
I got shit on the scene so 99 can't hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret and there's no rest
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
In Dynasties.I-ROCs... and Caravans and muthafuckas are swolen
Like paper stacks and a rubberband
Goin all out of tact on the local bird slaggin brothaman
And be servin as slow as fuck
Cause my niggaz are nervous
and if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggaz is happy with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town
Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my tags off my buick and yall know I didn't love that
Rollin on some white balls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, YOU GOTS TO DO YOUR OWN NAILS!
I told my niggaz to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town
God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back up!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my click
Got the birds, and reopen my lab back up
And told my boys, "If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye,
Don't give him a chance to identify!"
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at random, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Close to the dopeman - God damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
CAUSE IN MY YARD IS A BIG ASS - I GOT YALE SIGN!
It's time for TONY MONTANA stacks
I got niggaz on the corner holdin big ass bags and cans of crack
The land of Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fools run in with your glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last love
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight lights
when the feds in town
<SONGEND>

<SONGSTART>When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone
I bought a Cadillac brought it to a street top
Started me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho ain't good in the city that
Had a fuckin hoe for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
Now what did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked it up myself and started passin out them hovers
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and bought a lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now all them laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones
Livin real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm sellin crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientel is growin
It's gettin so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump
Fuck Black Caesar niggaz call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggaz fuck wit other niggaz shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is comin up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody makin green
Gettin cash for puttin stones in the pockets of the fiends
Business boomin daily, my product sellin fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Cut a fifty up into a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hover tens
Gotta pocket full of stones startin all over again!!!

I'm ridin' dirty, know what I'm sayin'?
Comin' down on the slab, boy
Ridin' dirty, for real tho, ridin' dirty
Have you ever been rollin' in a clean ass 'Lac
Blowin' big out the window, everybody got a sack
Got my heat right between my seat, got a box of them thangs
In case these fools start playin' with me
You'd be surprised how them boppers wink, girl, I can't stop
Give my headlights a blink and roll them up out the top
And keep movin' and keep rollin'
Fools that don't be holdin' I'm comin' through and foldin'
And I can't stand snitches, wanna kill all of y'all
Even though some bustas fall I'm still rollin' like a ball
And having things my way, hittin' that highway
Sellin' that big yay, a plush-ass place to stay
Police, they wanna run in
Talkin' on cell phones got a lotta kids done in
I wanna live like Arnold, Willis and Mr. Drummond
And keep my paper sturdy, big birds and tight herbs
Fool, I'm ridin' dirty
Big birds and tight herbs, fool I'm ridin' dirty
Ridin' dirty, fool, ridin' dirty
Tell me can you feel it? Man, nothin' can save ya
I believe it's that season for gettin' yo papers
Or haven't you heard about them birds? We call it that cheese
In Texas we get it with ease, hit I-10 if you please
But these polices, they think they sharp as creases
For no reasons, man, they straight up strippin' cars to pieces
Out of suspicion or if they thinkin' you on a mission
Ain't no wishin' or prayin', they sayin' assume the position
Hands behind ya head, down on ya knees
You get the case and they get yo weight and yo G's
Come on, I use to ride the Port Arthur city streets
With a chick with pretty feets and a box of Philly Sweets
They tried to finish me but couldn't get it done
So somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty
Man, somebody told the law Big Bun was the one ridin' dirty
Sup PA, uh, what, ridin' dirty

<SONGSTART>[Pimp C:]
One with a trigger, two with a bat
Three big brothers, fo' - wanna squab with me
So I guess a brother gotta throw
Tell 'em like this, ya better get up out my camp dude
Befo' I have to pull my gat and get, real rude
I don't figure that it's worth gettin hurt
Just 'cause ya gal wanna give me that skirt
Bet it feels funny when ya doin 69
Knowin that ya sippin on all my jimmy wine
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bad
Knowin that ya swallowed all the skeeter that I had?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda shot you up instead I told ya somethin good
[Chorus: sampled from Chaka Khan & Rufus' "Something Good"]
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah... yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
[Bun B:]
Aiyyo, what's up with that bulge in ya khakis?
You wanna pack a gat, but you STILL ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gangload of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cause by yourself, you're runnin to the flo'
I seen your kind befo', man ya nothin with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin when ya chillin with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin up some daisies
See crazy you wanna be, but punks with no heart, they ain't hard
They just waitin for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep your weak self locked in ya hood
Cause without your boys I'm a have to tell ya somethin good
[Chorus]
(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)
[Pimp C:]
Brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check ya girl and what she did in the past
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her REAL fast
But I don't trust the dugout, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check ya blood and let somebody check your teeth
But if you don't step, I'm a drop on ya fast
And pump off bullets like government cash
I didn't do ya girl but your sister was alright
Took her to my homeboy's Caddy last night [girl moaning in the background]
She waxed my jimmy, and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit if from the back, and the girl just THREW ME
Told me, "Pump it harder, " and she scratched me on my BOOTY
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty lil' girl
[Chorus 1/2]
[Bun B:]
Let's talk about these half-n-half punks
By day they sorry bastards, at night they talkin bout, poppin trunks
Butter .25 cain't keep you alive
From a sawed-off, fool so I hope you survive
See bluffin might save ya tail one day
But who's ta say, it won't catch ya next week, on the runway?
You might shoot a few shots in the wind
But the same time tomorrow, you'll be runnin again
Now can you keep it up, every damn night?
You steady runnin to the argument but runnin from the fight
What's the deal man? Why don't you take your Raiders cap off?
Cause one of these days, you gonna getcha head slapped off
You cain't keep a crew cause they gettin sick of seein you bail
Like a punk'll hit the backstreet trail
And the women don't like you cause ya act like them
And that's why your little jimmy never went fo' a swim
Ya talk about slangin, makin G's
But I saw a fiend chase ya from, BJ's up to Mickey D's
Now everyday punks get took
Either for they dough, they'll ride 'em for the powder that they cook
You bookin from the scene cause ya couldn't hold ya own
A 40 ounce bottle slams, ya dead to your dome
Now you want revenge, so ya get your automatic
Find a group of hard-heads, and startin kickin static
Ya pulled ya little chrome but these fools got gats
Try to run and caught two buckshots in ya back
Now you nothin but a memory that's gone in a slayin
So when I tell you somethin good, punk I don't be playin

Back, bitch (uh)...Kool Ace (whuut), UGK...(huh)
[Chorus: Pimp C]
Pimpin' ain't no illusion,
And pimpin' ain't never died.
Mo' pimps was on that heroin
And yo' pimp tripped out on that fry.
The dikes done came through
And straight threw off all the game;
Got all these hoes thinkin'
They could manage they own change.
[Kool Ace:]
But it ain't no illusion,
I know... you all have witnessed
He rollin' in my Caady mo'
Wit' fly bitches,
Makin' ole deals: Now, ho (huh, huh)
Ain't Bob Barker
But I'm caught up in this game
Mo' like... Peter Parker.
P-I-M-P, take the P's that I am.
I want you payin' hoes in my army
Like... uh... Uncle Sam,
And we gon' jam...
I'm talkin' 'bout the world greatest show
I know my shit is extreme
But I'm all about them does.
When I'm steppin' on the scene
Be there four deep... hella clan
My reality is your favorite dream
(Stop that shit, daddy...)
Best believe Kool Ace gon' keep it real.
Pimp C & Bun B to testify for the ear
Excuse me, y'all, but this about Southern shit.
Now, tell me can you... uh... feel this, bitch?
We givin' 'em brain contusions...
Pimp C, what's the conclusion?
[Pimp C:]
Pimpin' ain't no illusion...
[Chorus: x2]
[Pimp C:]
Pimpin' ain't dead... nigga, it just began
(How the fuck you know Sweet Jones?)
My hoes still out there sellin' ass.
Yo' bitch is out of pocket,
'Cause yo' pimpin' was scary;
Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy.
Fuck niggas watch them mack and pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what y'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'.
This is the conclusion: pimpin' ain't no illusion.
[Chorus: x2]
Bun B:
If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her,
'Cause a beggar ain't a muthafuckin' chooser.
Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean.
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a wif a this...
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior... and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny... sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again... that's why...
[Chorus: x2]
Too $hort:
You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money... it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game.
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it.
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin'...beeyatch.
[Chorus: x3]
...pimpin' ain't no illusion

<SONGSTART>So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part."
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy
Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
"Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it"
"Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets"
"Had to tie her to a rocket"
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
"Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up"
"Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up"
"(Shit)"

Niggas ain't real, must'a started smokin' rocks

While these bitches suckin' dick
And droppin' to the ground

While these bitches suckin' dick

On my team, sippin' lean
Ain't no thang of the past
The '84 Beritz with the slant back ass
Keepin' me a pro, next to my fo'
Instead of stackin' cheese
He steady screamin' to that hoe, let me see it
Fuck ass nigga, fuck ass nigga

They diamonds ain't shinin' and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm grippin' on the grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm workin' wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville, your step daddy can get killed
If he keeps talkin' shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you tryin' to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the South
For them niggas and them girls with them golds in they mouth
The boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill, bitch you ain't what this about, about
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit

Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, it was made for me to gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my

Too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars, baby ballin'
Bullshitter, frontin' like rottweiliers, no bark, no bite
But showin' thangs, talkin' loud like they knowin' thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane, your ass mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight, it ain't no passin' tonight

Waitin' for me to fall but yet they comin' off the wall
Till I'm ready, keep the gun steady and ready
For anybody crossin' the line with get that fuck shit

With a rusty ass niner lookin' for trouble

<SONGSTART>Hold up
It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggaz brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital
Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that
There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?"
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'

So I'm digging in my mind for the bitches I broke
And keep a player paid in full cause pimping ain't no joke
You want to pop that pussy that's a slim ass chance
Put the paper in the panties when you get that dance
This C.O.D. nigga, so you can keep your nuh plastic cards
No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers
But why slap us when you think a nigga down on his luck
You try and flag us when you see us coming down in a buck
Now what the fuck part of the game taught y'all that bitch play
See we makes a bitch pay

I don't stunt and blow smoke up your ass baby
But don't be acting all saditty with class baby
You with a nigga such as my self it'll cost you
So pay before a nigga fuck around and be the tosser

And most of y'all niggaz ain't nothing but tricks
But we sipping lean and breaking bricks
Popping pills, work the wood wheel

Balling down on Beale Street
Sipping on a pint of syrup
Chopping up the chronic weed
Picking all the fucking seeds
Trying to slow my roll
In my trunk I got them fucking keys
Always riding Chevy things
Shining on them twanky things
Kids I'm a role model
Police I'm a dope man
Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead
Never has it left my mouth
Optimos a fifth of crown
Red eyes with a frown
Niggaz with them gold teeth
Fast talking on the town
Some of us are under cover

Knot in my right pocket
Left pocket got them rubbers
Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash

If your calico to mask, if you Baptist go to church
See a hoe up in a nigga, gon pull up a skirt

Niggaz scheming on my bezel, on some devilish shit
I been to hell and back, on another level you bitch
Go on try it I'm going live, they gon need a shovel for you bitch
I been stabbed I been shot, went from no fans to being hot
But somehow always fall short, for trying to keep fiddles in my pot
In a dog eat dog world, y'all fellas be chasing girls
When I place myself in history, too hot for a ladder to catch me
But I can't help but to notice, I'm one of the coldest
And I know y'all haters love when I'm locked up, but I won't lose focus
Yeah I wrote this counting down, how many days I got
So lately my gun ain't been hid, it's been displayed a lot
My attitude is fucked up, I don't give a fuck cause I just don't give one
Thinking bout living a life where everything you do right is wrong, mo'fucker I live one
I know niggaz wanna kill me, but I'm still riding pride
Cause the Lord riding with me, and that's the main reason why
Some niggaz win, and some niggaz lose
Some niggaz getting bruised, some always crying to blues
Some niggaz already lost, and ain't gon lose no mo'
Big shoes hoe choose, ain't paying dues no mo'
Everything y'all trying to do, I built a school hoe
Now it's fly to talk country, I made the rules hoe
I was sagging in my khaki's, 'fore Dickies cool
Gangsta Nike's on my feet, our music banging in the streets
The young B.G.'s, really love to thump
Fuck radio and BET, I'm out here bumping in the trunk
For the girls popping pussy, and the boys with the blow
Cadillac'ers and flat-backers, I'm out here repping for it hoe
Can't any man, boy or woman take away my soul
It's a gift given from God, and I'm keeping a tight hold
The world is ugly and cold, trying to make me the same
But I'ma keep it one hundred, when it come to the game
Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up
We keep it click tight, so when niggaz start lurking
In the dark heaters start, anybody start jerking
Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg
A dragging society, don't borrow don't beg
For tomorrow so gon 'head with your pity, I'ma be cool
Kindergardeners was looking up to me, in pre-school
Down with Pimp C fool, and P-A-T the town
Representing it to the fullest, till I'm gone I hold it down
Bun Beater, would never sell you no lie
So if you ask for the truth, I'ma reply to trill niggaz don't die

Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight

That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggaz, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up

Everything was cool, I was ice cold

Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from

Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine
(Rick Ross:)
You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
And my yayo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

Still dwelling on the past
Time for Slim Shady, you can kiss my ass
I got my Mind Made Up, when
I can, When I can't do things
Cause I gotta an acting career
Not a new thing
always been a Great performer just ask Warners
Eminem, Just the way I am
Poverty, fame, drugs
And all they say is Stan
I've been through heartaches
And depressions, but
But I'm getting out the message
It would be no fun without Me
You have to fail sometimes
To get me, Eminem we love you
Child Molestation jokes, We hate you,

It was entertainment for y'all

I got my Mind Made Up
When I can kick it, I kick it
All I do is spit rhymes
They won't let me be timid
Or Fainthearted
I will reach my dynasty like Billy Austin
I'm an Army that will never diminish
I was down with the best rapper out now
Discussion, should have been it
State of the art of mind
Damn, he's inventive
Make's ya Keep wishing
Are you chasing life or watching it go
I'm a Giant in this game
Here, these rappers ain't good for store
Too weak, must be a birth defect
Can't stand on their two feet
That means Raplete's infection
If you play against me, synonym of ill
Opposite of well, can't anticipate me
You're in a position to fail
If you're not sick, as far or rhyming
Or studying to go to College
Don't be hiding, call in Mr.
Institution, and Institution
In the sense of scholastic
Improvement, going to college
And having a profession, you can do it
Getting a diploma, get your degree
Life ain't perfect, in this cool world of 16 degrees

<SONGSTART>Whassup, muthafucka? Yeah it's the funk droppa, the punk stoppa
The trunk poppa, ready to break y'all off somethin' proper
You know I'm a villain so why try?
Fuck a glock, I'm throwin' a glock party, darin' niggas to drive by
I came to smoke a son of a bitch that went for his but didn't pull it
Fast enough and got blasted up with a bullet
I'm snipin', I got you in my scope so what's the use of tryin' to bail?
I'm ready to catch a case but not for yayo, for a murder, mayne
187 ways to rip ya spine out anytime you wanna test
Say you never heard of pain? Wait till I pull my nine out
And empty out a clip in yo chest cavity
Haven't we been known for takin' it
To the sucka muthafuckas that was fakin' it
Makin' it known I gots my chrome in my ride
And I'm fried, PA nigga worldwide from the Westside, fool
Yeah, I'm serious and this is one of three sixteens
Yeah, ya bastards, I'm serious, this is only one of three sixteens
Straight up, I'm serious that was only one of three sixteens
Now check this shit out
It's DJ DMD, back with that funk flowin' lazy
Kinda crazy, never letting niggas fade me, I'm a little fast on the trigga
Niggas, I get my blast on nightly, you don't wanna fight me
Take yo ass on down the block, I keeps my shit cocked
So knock on wood 'cuz shit could get hot
On this spot, some niggas catchin' lead shots
'Cuz ain't no wipin' off these red dots
Now try me if you think I won't bust
Shots to ya dome will leave ya ass in the dust, nigga
'Cuz ain't nobody droppin' bigger hits
I'm makin' tracks upon, track upon, tracks to make these niggas shit
And I'm down with some fa sho, niggas
So tell me how you gon' diss me with a clique full of ho niggas?
You keep yo ass in yo muthafuckin' set
Or take a slug in ya muthafuckin' chest, Reggie
Mark ass nigga, ya punk bitch
I'm serious and this is two of three sixteens
Ya punks, I'm serious, this is two of three sixteens
Punk ass niggas, I'm serious, this was two of three sixteens
Sixteen number three
Some muthafuckas think they can go with me
But most of them niggas just some hoes to me
I got a lotta niggas that's down with me
But too many niggas like to clown with me
They act like they know me but they really don't
They ask me to come kick it but they know I won't
I see they ass in PA, they don't know me
I see they ass in Houston, I'm they homie
But nigga, how it feel to be a ho?
Gettin' yo ass kicked at every muthafuckin' show
Tryin' to be a gangsta but nigga you's a fool
And tryin' to kick it with me, like me and y'all cool
But nigga, let's see if you can with that chrome
I shoulda popped yo ass when you rolled into my home
But bitch niggas steal and G niggas mack
And busta ass niggas gettin' bullets in they back
And that's a muthafuckin' fact
Ya little muthafucka, I'm serious
And that was three of three sixteens
For any niggas that wanna test
Come up and stress these three muthafuckin' sixteens
You can't fuck wit it, fool
We drops three of three sixteens
And ain't a muthafucka tight like this
We droppin' three tight ass sixteens
Yeah, I wanna send this out to all them niggas in the ward
You know what I'm sayin'? That drop all that muthafuckin' shit
Like we drop that shit and to all them other muthafuckas

Yo, the nigga was trill, same shit, new place

She might be shit to you, cause dude give her pay G
But pussy get played out, and pussy comes daily
As long as your game be strong ain't no thang
My phone always rang cause of the dope shit I sang
Keepin hoes on my dick yo, and ain't no lettin go
The net keeps flyin out, the pussy stays wet so
I turn on my VCR then I put a flick in
The hoe starts lickin that dick and pretty soon
I'm stickin that ass, like a fool in the bed
All I can see, is the top and back of your head
It ain't about conversation or make that hit
On a first name basis hoe that ain't bout shit!
Look trick, tell me how many rubbers to pack
I hit the room from the front, the ass from the back
And yo it ain't about the phone call, this about the nut'n
So let me bust a fat load on your bellybutton
See, quiet storm done put a notch on your belt
And when it's over, I don't wanna hear how it felt
I'm just pullin off my rubber, takin a bath
Gettin dressed to reminisce of how I cut ya in half
It's all in the day of an Underground fool
So dial the digits and I'm divin in that ass like a pool
But when I get wet BITCH, I won't be drownin
I clown on hoes to leave their pussyhole frownin
Or if you bitches wanna hear some more of this
Lock your bedroom door trick, pick up your cordless
You can suck a mean dick, lick a good ball
And if I keep on fuckin, you'll keep on callin
And I'll be playin you, when you think you'll be playin me
It's just pussy games with some help from AT&T
So if you need a dick to be real friendly
Dial nine-seven-six, B-U-N-B, bitch!
