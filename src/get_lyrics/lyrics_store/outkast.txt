 <SONGSTART> Intro: Big Rube
Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
that we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level -- what are we doing?
Foolin ourself, clownin ourself, playin ourself
By not bein ourself
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get our meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand up on the section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind rumbing reality of horror
known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon...
(My memories of yesterday...)
cut and scratched: "Ninety-six gonna be that hit..."
Verse One: Andre
I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they makin they paper so I guess I can't complain... or can I?
I feel they disrespectin the whole thang
Them hooks like sellin dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serve ain't tastin right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it
I'm confessin one mo' lesson from the South we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
where me and my niggaz surpassed the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
while my close niggaz laugh at
The Southern slang, figure ways and mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen
Started by Afrikan Bambaata, so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts
Musical Interlude: Debra Killings
(Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turns my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday...)
Verse Two: Big Boi
Uhh, born Antwan Patton but my potnahs they call me Big Boi
It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speakin the truth not talkin that shit boi
I'm thinkin of checkin my traps and bustin my raps and throwin them craps
Seven-eleven is no convenience, you pumpin your gas, they're watchin yo' back
For the robbin crew, thinkin they robbin you, you must be cautious
To stand up on yo' game and pimpin these crows you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat, but fuckin these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know of I wanna be playin but runnin up on me like you miss me
You catchin the wrong vibe, packin yo' shit and rollin yo' eyes back
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems I'm reachin out and touchin the wrong nigga
Don't expect it to be pimpin get your index off the trigger
As we bust, us, be leavin em in the dust
So keep that cain up out of your nose I said my piece and then I hush
As the candidate keeps flippin... niggaz dippin...
Musical Interlude
Verse Three: Andre, Big Boi
My dearly beloved we are gathered to life
Like soap is the lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh like Liberty Bells yes them bullets keep on rangin
On fire like the Georgia mass choir we keep on sangin
Bringin our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Psych because no one is free when others are oppressed
So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old
Like some eagles, people don't understand
Just like their parents don't be carin
I'm speakin about you playin with that phony stuff you sharin
in your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinkin you got it, but get it get it, but you ain't pimpin no bitches
Cause you flaw, in, fallin like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smokin good and sloppy head on highways
Friday's are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old
Musical Interlude 2X
("96 gonna be that hit...")
(Like memories of yesterday...)
*voice of Andre fades in*
see all them leaves must fall down, growin old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow brown
Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin old
(repeat 3X)
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like "yeah, nigga right"
But you gave me you number anyway you were on the talcum
Powder, how's about them oranges
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a mission impossible
We were both the same age but I
Suppose wasn't on the same page but in
The same book of life so I'd paged you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We starting hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head I'm thinking cool
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be
Heaven or Hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
You'd dropped me off by the dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
Now are these niggaz in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?
Well, yes and no
Yes we were selling it
But no it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled "ho"
Meanwhile the video starts playing
BET college radio and a van
Packed full of niggaz with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear
You know what I'm saying
But, I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But, when I got home I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur
Who replied see you later when he got the good news, that's life shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque but I'm living with my pop pop
So I got glock and a low jack
You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much 'cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you tell me then I'll double back
But keep in mind, at the time "keep it real" was the phrase
Silly once said now, but those were the days
When spring break
And Daytona
And Freakniks
Made you wanna
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the south but that ain't a Kodak
Moment, on went myself and big boi
Well, you knew him as Twan
That's right you were around before this shit begun
When Twan had a daughter and
Sort of was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like jack
Laughed and cried and drived it back with some Yak
Girls used to say, y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?
And I'd laugh and they just keep smiling
No, I'm from Atlanta, baby
He from Savannah, maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down hey we
Got to go because the bus is pulling out in 30 minutes
She's playing tennis disturbing the tenants
15-love
Fit like glove
Description is like
15 doves
In a Jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?
Enough about me
How's about you?
How's the lil' kid?
She was about 2 the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
Cause I'd start the second album off on another note
Now, that note threw some niggaz in the 'hood off
But see I'd balled out, and before I fall out
I'd Slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain is that fried egg I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor staring
So changing my style was like release for the primitive beast
Yes I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread - never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas, and macaroni niggaz - imposters
So on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreds with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now you know her
As Erykah on and on Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone why you
Do that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed
The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name
We're young, in love, in short we had fun
No regrets no abortion, had a son
By the name of Seven
And he's five
By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six
You do the arithmetic
Me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded me throw the darts
To poke you in the heart
And take you from the start
To one luxury transportation and a Marta card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays
Momma or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she's smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up. you trick it out. you give it rims. you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
.And that's as far as I got
[Dialogue]
And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go
knowing the whole time that's all you could think about
even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up
you need a jump like you'll need in your rump to grow
and you change all the time so that rabbit that you thought about
that whole summer, the next summer you didn't want that rabbit no more
you wanted something bigger and better
So the summer past and the rabbit is old?
Right, right, so now you want a Cadillac...

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die

Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain, nothing lasts forever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I, Aquemini
[Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, "Get on the bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping is a must
Is you on the that dust or cornstarch familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman how and the fuck you think we gon do that man
Riding around Old National on 18's without no gat man
Im strapped man and already to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fittin
But now we tappin the breaks from all of them corners that we be headin in a
Volkswagen and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't go get wood grain steering wheel
For real you can gon chill out and still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fuckin beeper bill bitch
[Chorus] x2
[Andre Benjamin]
Twice upon a time there was a boy who died and
Lived happily ever after but that's anotha chapter live
From home of the brave with dirty dollas
And beauty parlors, and baby bottles and bowling ball impalas
And street scholars that majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread, cheese, and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what cha bought so cut that big talk
Lets walk to the bridge now meet me half way
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
Its them poor babies walkin slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin bad need some hope like the words maybe if or problay
More than a hobby when my turntables get wobbly they dont fall
I'm sorry y'all I often drift I'm talkin gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of coarse you know I feel like a bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but its needed so what have you
Now question is every nigga wit dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?.nah
So don't get caught in appearance
Its OutKast Aquemini another black experience
OKAY
[Chorus] x2
[Big Boi]
The name is Big Boi Daddy fat sax the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets cause these strets is where my folks at
Betta know that some say we pro-black boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks you must bust a rhyme we must bust back
Get get back for reals niggas that's out here trying to spit facts
You here dat you cant come near dat maybe you need yo quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin shit like this/(Yea Yea Yea)
[Andre Benjamin]
My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it, that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in wit yo kin
Look again cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again wish I could tell you when
Andre this is Andre y'all just gon have to make amends
[Chrous] x2
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Well, it's the M I crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
Oh Hell, there he go again talkin' that shit
Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spend
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out you scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy fat sacks, B I G B O I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Givin' the shout out to my Uncle Donnel locked up in prison
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer
Now, my oral demonstration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothin' better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to be the hard regardless of the skintone
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone
The alienators 'cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach and don't lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply? Now everybody say
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer
Everyday I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinkin' about the second album at the Dungeon shootin' pool
Like E S to the P N, 'cause we adjust to the beat in the zone
Honey I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sittin' at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team and like
The daddy's wife you makin' the coffee
You heard the ATLiens so back the hell up off me
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger not to embark
The world's a stage and everybody gots to play they part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speakin' through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay?
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say oh yea yer

 <SONGSTART> [Dre]
1, 2... 1, 2, 3; yeah!
In-slum-national, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Woo!)
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans
You can't stop a train
Who want some? Don't come un-prepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soaking wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
One-Nine-Nine-Nine, Anno Domini, anything goes, be whatchu wanna be
Long as you know consequences, to give and for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell
HOT! Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell, look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm and Hammer, soul gold grill and some baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of pampers
Stack of question with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
before he left adds up, to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe,
believe there's always more, ahhhhh!
[Chorus: 2X]
[Dre] Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
[Choir] Bombs over Baghdad!
[Dre] Yeah! Ha ha yeah!
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
[Choir] Bombs over Baghdad!
[Dre] Yeah! Uhh-huh
[Big Boi]
Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and we still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend, dying to geek
Outkast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back, Cadillac, 'bout five nigga deep
Seventy-five MC's freestylin' to the beat
Cause we get crunk, stay crunk, at the club
Should have bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Should have held back, but you throwed the punch
'Spose to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to-the U to-the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turn my back on my kids for them
Should have hit it (hit it) quit it (quit it) rag (rag) top (top)
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four, but we on the road
Hold up, slow up, stop, control
Like Janet, Planets, Stankonia is on ya
A movin' like Floyd comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
I like a three piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pity PAT rappers tryin' to get the five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL boi you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, hah!
[Chorus: 2X]
[Dre] Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
[Choir] Bombs over Baghdad!
[Dre] Yeah! Ha ha yeah!
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
[Choir] Bombs over Baghdad!

Bombs over Baghdad! Yeah
Bombs over Baghdad! Yeah
Bombs over Baghdad! Yeah
Bombs over Baghdad! Yeah

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I came into this world high as a bird
From second hand cocaine powder
I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies offs
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bonified nigga like me
Can't even get no back rub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down
'Cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now that's hard
While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats
Nigga they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'
To keep my faith in you, in you
(Yo, yo, yo)
I'm fascinated by the way yo
Nipples peak at me through yo blouse
Freaky me, freaky you
Can't help but be aroused
'Scuse me Lord less for thinkin'
But that's the way we was brought up
Sneakin' to watch playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is alot like when we went to the woods
And laid with the squirrels
Durin' P.E., we'd be
Exploring each others privates
Hunchin' with all our clothes on
Until we felt excited then, aah
Oh now it's on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere
If you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Now if two hearts done walk on out
And I see you on the next song
They call it horny
'Cause it's devilish
Now see we dead wrong
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'
To keep my faith in you, in you
People don't know the stress I'm dealing with day to day
Speakin' about the feeling I'm possessing for rene
Mopin' around and wondering where she stay
Saw her last that she lay
Give it another day I say
But the Lord he taketh away
Now give it back lawd
'Cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas that owned the ligour store
Crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Livin' up on this earth
Before a nigga like daddy was born
But they makin' a scene
That my music and crime are a team
But I'm speakin' the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean
My lyrics ain't clean
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'
To keep my faith in you, in you
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'
To keep my faith in you, in you
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'
To keep my faith in you, in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith

 <SONGSTART> Sophistophone, aristocats
Distinguished stars, clean up your acts
Pull up your pants, ladies and gents
Please, act like you got some sense
You know what I really wanna know?
Where do all the good girls go
What clubs they hang at?
Behold a lady
I see you standin' on the wall
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?
Today I might snow, tomorrow I'll rain
3000'S always changing but you stay the same
And I need that, hey I need that (in my life)
When I feel washed up and inadequate
And throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get
You make me smile, you make me smile
You make me smile, you make me (Hooooo!)
You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking
You won't let me drown and I'm grateful
Behold a lady
I see you standin' on the wall
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?
Baby you disappeared with the dinosaurs
Oh but that's just the big bang theory
Maybe they're still around
But only to be seen with appreciative eyes
Maybe they were taken for granted
And lost all their magic
Oh how awful
Oh so tragic
Yo' mama's old fashioned, yo' daddy don't play
You'll always be this lovely
'Cause they raised you that way
Hallelujah! Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord
You're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane
The yin to my yang, darlin'
You've got that thang and you know it
But yet you don't (But yet you don't) and that's what's so cool
You don't say too much, but when you do it's profound
In the street you hold your head high
At home you get low down for me
Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah
Hoooo! You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinkin', you won't let me drown (Aaaaaaahh!)
Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums
To see what a lady looks like
Behold a lady
I see you standin' on the wall
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?
So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight
If you spot one, good sir, treat her right
This is Benjamin Andre signing off
Thanks a million
Good luck and goodnight
Behold a lady
I see you standin' on the wall
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?
Behold a lady
I see you standin' on the wall
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Clap, clap you deserve it all
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find

Verse One: Big Boi, Andre
Yeah, yeah check it
From alligator belts to patty melts I be that smoothest nigga
So hwo do you figga that Atlant don't be pullin dem triggas
The Southernplayalistic pimp is up in this bitch
Man, my folkers up on that track, complimentin that wickedness
See one is for the money two is for my niggaz who jack
Niggaz ain't takin that shit no mo' they got big Benz and Cadillac
My gat is in my lap, so whatchu wanna be startin now?
I'm pissin up on Jeffrey's Dahmer grave that cracker was foul
Too close for comfort, too close to home
Too close to be playin yo ass so hey why don't you get yo' own
As long, as I got this legally
People see that we can be on top of things without causin
another nigga sorrow, I know it seems it ain't enough to go around
But keep on holdin on like Goodie Mob cause it's a better day tomorrow
That's all I can say, can't tell the future
Tomorrow's another day but today, they just might shoot you
For your ride, fuck your pride, hah better be out your seat
Quick and snappy with a happy face before you bleed
Ask me, if that material shit is worth yo' life
I don't know about yours but if so you smokin pipes right

Verse Two: Andre, Big Boi
Deep in the dungeon for these many months
Amongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around dem blunts
Had to cut it out like Cheers, but for years I used to burn em
Gettin deep in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum
Chest/chess, I never played but made many a moves
I still blame it on session cause I can't remember the due
I guess, I feel that gettin a Benz is out of the question
The world is yellin Hootie Hoo but in my pockets nuthin but
gum and lint, to sum the shit, of I'm broke
Nothin but hope, so Big Boi, tell em what you toke
I'm travellin up to Jersey with four keys off in my trunk
And thinkin of startin the ways to get that motherfucker krunk
See yes I be that nigga that with that sess off in my chest
Smokin and tokin them token blacks, that wanted to test
See strong niggaz survive and the weak niggaz they die
I never fuck no white bitch, I stop eatin that pig sty
Be activatin that Lo-Jack cause the Fleetwood has been stolen
Campalton Road is open, the B-I-G has spoken
Cause it's like this
Verse Three: Big Boi, Andre
I got these thoughts, similar to the ones that call in the wild
Up in the Benz is where I be doin about a hundred miles
The world is FUCKED UP how these niggaz be drivin drunk
Vehicular homicide with their bodies off in your trunk
To me the cards is not belong I use that strong arm robbery
Robbin spree, look at me, W-M-B
Backwards, takin you to the cha cha with these verses
Comin around the projects make you sleep off in dem hearses
I got a word of wisdom, for those who must be zest
You'll be needin a physical therapist, cause you can't fuck with this
While you sat down by the seashore thinkin about some seashells
I was around the corner from Clemson Hills thinkin about the V-12
But maybe not for long because I just done seen the light
I'm packin my screwdriver so see I'm gon' be alright
Just moving the steering wheel side to side like a slalom
Now I ain't got no problem I'm just breakin the steerin column
I spot him, in the middle of the MARTA parkin lot
I'm hearin a voice in the back of my head yellin "Andre stop!"
But do I stop, naw I figure it's a come up
But now I'm goin down cause the folks wanna run up
DAMN!

My torpedo, you libido
Need to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
I'm your are-o-l-a-I-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
What ya mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where I's
Oh, lord! How can it be so hard??
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat!
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack!
As we strut skip the line through the glass window glance
We look fine, right on time
As we step in the place the nursery's crunk we've come to play
Everybody's watching 'cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me!! Throw your hands up if you feel me!!

Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why

[Verse 1]
What if everything you ever knew or known was lost
The needs tend to freeze you when you gatherin' yo thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
cause your mind ain't free, constricting by the motherf**kin' boundaries
An ounce of weed or an pound of dro
Couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting life from bro
brother, brohem
Cadillac on bows, strike a pose then the door slams, wham nigga wham, don't they say that in they show damn
For show man, actin like a tadpole out of gonads, you now how catch the truth, hit the booth we makin more jams
Spread the strawberry preserves on your nervous program, f**k the learning curve
We took our ramp to no man's land
Hello, is anybody home, is anybody givin dome
Serve me up I want some
[Chorus]
Buggface toe jam, from the face up 'cause you don't give a jam
Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jammin, shovin it up your monkey jam
Buggface toe jam, from the face up 'cause you don't give a jam
Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jammin, shovin it up your monkey jam
[Verse 2]
When I'm left alone I get to thinking to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste so use it until none's left
Like everything is alright clearly tight to death
I can see clearly now analyzing every step
Clearly you can feel me 'cause it's beating through your chest
And you can see me clearly through the window paint drip wet wet
with no tint not yet, clearly I'm a vet
And not a vetinarian, but clearly pitbulls are the best
Like the O-U-T-K-S, cleary nigga you know the rest
And if you acting like you don't, cleary nigga you trying to test
Crystal clearly I confess, and I suggest, you clear the runway
'cause the ticket is a one-way, clearly back we won't be coming
[Chorus]
Buggface toe jam, from the face up 'cause you don't give a jam
Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jammin, shovin it up your monkey jam
Buggface toe jam, from the face up 'cause you don't give a jam
Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jammin, shovin it up your monkey jam
Can I dance?

Oh shit, bamboo! Stop! [Laughing]

Slinging petty corruption the seventh sign
Yeah give it to you and I do what it takes to give it to you

Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckas are the ones that are I chose
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we cared
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggaz that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
But my hunger is the thought that no wonder it can't be smothered
Or buttered up buttercup melt your sauce
You a chucky cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer that soft
And I'm sick as a cough did I mention it's raw?
Your predicaments is flaw flaw means fucked up
And serving out the oven not fried slow roast
Slow coast tuck your tail and hide your scared?
Yeah give to you and I do what it takes to give it to you
(Bust bust)
I officially do it with duns on tour
We lock down traps push caps galore
My wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish
My old earth even known to handle biz
I serve whipped out of whips whip out cash
Usually keep a g packed under the dash
Try to test my gangsta I bring harm
I'm as slick as freeway rick and Nicholas Barnes
My uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar
My waistline hold a 4 pound baretta
I'll shoe lace your face just to learn you better
My ox so sharp it cut through leather
My rap name killer my street name skunk
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx
I switch my slang spit from my mouth
I'm still all coast my coast is the south
Yeah give to you and I do what it takes to give it to you
(Bust bust)

 <SONGSTART> Dre]
I'll be comin around the ghetto when I come kickin one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm pickin up and throwin 'em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cuz I slam those Southern bitches
I ain't braggin, folks draggin me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggaz with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm makin 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of niggaz tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin like hell without no paddle
But niggaz is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is
Chorus: Cee-Lo
I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me (repeat 4X)
[T-Mo]
As I step, the stage is empty
No words as I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' main
Smokin that dang dang, makin mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me
Cruisin down the block, just like I was a squirrel
In a world full of nuts, damn
I'd probably be mad even if I called him Uncle Sam
So bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie rather be
Don't flex on next, I break necks too
Rollin with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?
chorus:
[Big Boi]
Yeah, I'm steady buckin muthafuckas
Not duckin 'em like the goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggaz
Squeezin rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breakin
Speakin of breakin, break on how to get your life taken, boy
Fuckin around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringin the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kickin it
Comin around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's quickly how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, ye
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinkin about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see that cash is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like... yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggaz around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, liftin weights, gettin swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string cuz these off in your ass with it hey
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothin, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cuz I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga
chorus:
[Khujo]
Khujo, comin in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into cappin
Throwin to do more load, so my fire lookin through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot with somethin wicked
But you can't feel it, stickin out your monkey ass
I could let shit rot in the past, now it's time to blast they ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scopin, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go on your hoe's bar
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of livin is beginning to be a risky business
Unkay, Parkay.
How do you like the taste of hot butter meltin through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Don't cut niggaz I hang with before there were apartments
In Chapel Forest, it's gettin horrid
The huntin child is on the prowl, yahhh!
I let out a call to da wild

 <SONGSTART> Zora and Rooster on the peach tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G while first comes the love now then comes the marriage. Wha wha one baby two baby three baby carriage baby
Welcome to my world, oceans versus mountains
Welcome to her world oceans versus mountains
Call me the poor girl cuz I luv to fight them
Call her the poor girl cuz she luvs to fight them
But I'm quite sweet if you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart browse around like a bone lost deep inside
See I'd like to fall in love, but not that type of guy
Oh wee got my clouds on fire, we type of walking in the worth-a-wild
Remember kissing on Broadway?
You die, I was being a baby and ticking and tocking
Go clock
See we done jumped the broom
And now you're no good
And I was dreaming about children
Emily Anne oh darling baby with the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me
And I needed your good love,
Baby how could you just go and
Change it all
You turned my spring to fall
I needed you, you know
But when the love is gone, it's time to go
If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm dying off of your love
I said I'm dying off of your love
I'm up to three o clock in the morning
While you're party out til the dawn and
Said I'm dying off of your love
Said I'm dying off of your love
Darlin ain't no feelin left
It's just the killin, Oh
Just grab my gun and lets go out
Just grab my gun and lets go out
It ain't no food for love
It's just this burning
Got me reelin
Call the law and hold the applause
Call the law and hold the applause
Four babies more babies workin on the six
We was only in our teens our dreams were simply stick
Jump the broom but it seems I tripped, I musta slipped
After exchanging of the rings these things you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride, the dippin of the groom
The shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room
More like boo hoo than boo, fuck who? Well fuck you too.
(Fuckin bitch) Kids cover them ears
It appears that your mama want drama
We need a comma or some space between words
For better or for worse
This is not what I deserve
The worst that I can take
Actually I want the cake and eat it too and plus your plate
But wait now don't you get the house, kids, cars,
Everything we built together was ours
Now it's all yours
That's hard
It's all yours
Good God!
If you don't think I mean it then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm dying off of your love
I'm up to three o clock in the morning
While you party out til the dawn and
Said I'm dyin off of your love
Said I'm dyin off of your love
Darlin ain't no feelin left

Zora - I really wish you could change baby
Well if my best ain't good enough I don't know what to tell you

 <SONGSTART> Yo, this is my story, this is my song
And to them rudypoots don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome
But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of Outkast, I cordially
Invite you to an emotion filled theater
Bring your umbrella 'cause young fella it gets no weirder
We reign, reign supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what it brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock 'n' roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what it brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock 'n' roll indubitably, piper pied
Just hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
You are now about entering the fifth dimension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high high, yeah, yeah my lord
To make one bob they head would be the track job
Tour job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhymin' for granted I won't comply
With that slackin', poppin' and crackin' 4th ward way we snappin'
They won't that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happenin', see if do what yo won't do today boy
Will I live tomorrow like you can't even live 'cause you strayed
Motivational skills lackin', when I see you nigga packin'
Understand that though, you behind a 75, 000 car do'
But you still stay with mom though playin' the King like Don Doe
You chocked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be locked up
Makin' them thick Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scared
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg
We reign, reign supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what it brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock 'n' roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what it brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock 'n' roll indubitably, piper pied
Just hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what it brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock 'n' roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what it brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole

Leave me aloone,

Aint' got much time left,

Chronomentrophobia [repeat 8x]
[Verse 2]
Lord, please have mercy on my soul,
I have the impression that my life goin' to be a bowl with cherries,
but it's going to be very hard for me to cope,
tired of being broke,
this ATLian aint' got no time to sit and mope,
made up my mind while yall made up yo beds,
on a cold wooden floor is where I lie my head,
born in 1975,
Never thought I would make it this far, I'm still battilin' this racial war,
tryin' to find solutions of the situation I face,
the only thing that is free is my flow that yall be chasin',
lettin' my niggas know before I go,
I drop that knowledge like dropping books,
lets stop the crooks from robbing you from your reins and such,
using wellfare as a cruch,
im in it for good,
you into my hood you wont be findin' much,
hope that when im gone yall remember this,
what we stood for,
fuck that fame make that glits,
it's begening to look a lot like the ending, got to be more careful,
know what corners you be benden, revalations is getting impatient,
now i'm dead,
remember what I said,
i'm gone,
bow yo heads

 <SONGSTART> Man, have you ever really wondered
Like why are we here? What the meanin to all of this?
[Chorus: Big Boi]
Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh.

[Verse One: Big Boi]
Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is goin downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
don't think that I can get out this hole
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday livin
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they livin
The unforgiven or the unwillin, live a life of sinnin
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginnin
[Interlude]
But what about repentance?
What about the tension?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
But what about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
over and over again and again and ah.
[Hook - singers]
Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr? OW!
[Verse Two: Big Boi]
Life, is nothin but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're bein evil then you on the devil's team
Well I receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sow those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask, to get a pass
or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences
The question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying
[Interlude]
But what about repentance?
What about the tension?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
But what about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
over and over again and again and ah.
[Chorus] (minus HALL-LE-LU-JAH singers)
Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh.
[Hook - singers]
Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr? OW!

Well it is I, the pimp playin nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hoe sellers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claimin true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money cuz my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
And nothin wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dippin and dodgin bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady tryin to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit, I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eatin watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now, to big felon
chorus: repeat 2X
I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggaz step up like the playas that's in back of me
[Dre]
All heavenly Father, why do you even bother watchin over me
Growin up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like comin harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you fly when niggaz flee
If it is one of my own, I'm lettin the trigger be
Cuz I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap of dap when I'm slangin quarter keys
Just tryin to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be workin niggaz butt naked
At Magic City, shakin titties just to pay the rent
Lord, tryin to hustle must be somethin that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinkin
I think about payback, strap myself and keep on dankin
Cuz I be takin the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you drainin like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little botty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

You let me hit the stage, that's when I got my folks hooked like...

Deeper than deep dish, hammers and vogues
Deeper fish in the O(cean)
I got my gun on standby, like Coast Guard
You boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like erb, word (hey man)
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse
I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catchin plagues
Niggaz catchin AIDS, niggaz gettin sprayed, niggaz on they way
To a dead end, you won't catch me spreadin no white thighs
I only see afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'
I'm Outkasted and claimin true
Aimin two at your muthafuckin spine
No, I make that three cuz I don't wanna hear you whine
Swine, got my folks blind, like Stevie

What? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill

Aimin for your skull, yeah I'm flexin on you that a way
So if you pullin a tool, nigga you better use it
Cuz if you're threatenin my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it
I don't take no shit from nobody, I gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me
Damn, no pain, no gain, some I'mma hurt you
Breakin knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
So if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it
Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it
It's just so simple when we get so D.E.E.P.
Learn a lesson, pick up the album when it hits the streets like...

No, I ain't never been pimped by the system
That's because I ain't no slave
Don't be tryin to sunbathe, never lived off in no cave
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Y'all think I'm stupid cuz I shoots 'em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it
My head's polluted cause I'm zooted, bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be havin funds
The gold that I am wearin is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and makin my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissin me off, I'm in that ass like interior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's livin on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor, can I get a little backup
Please don't let them pussy muthafuckas put that flag up
But let me shut up cause they say we need dough
whenever the fuck out record comes out in 1994
Yeah, yes sir, it's like that
Gonna take y'all deep, so go back
chorus: (2X)
[Big Boi]
I'm gettin deeper than that prostiutes vagina
And pimpin way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China
I roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior
Niggaz try to bite that shit, but their shit is inferior
We rollin thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy
And I don't give a damn, muthafucka cuz you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hairy bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tight ass draws cause I got a short ass fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this
They call me Big Boi, I be cappin with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah
Uh huh, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Good and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa, I'm dickin' the hoe down, never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Daver, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer eight-hundred-forty
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the hoe up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too"
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD and a fuckin' poster
It's like that now
It's like that now, you better go, get the hump, up out your back now
It's about four, five cats off in my 'Llac now
We just shoot, game in the form of story rap now, yeah
It's like that now, it's like that now
Now Suzy Skrew had a partna named Sasha Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber party
But you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning, yawnin', dancin' under street lights
We chillin' like a villain and a nigga feelin' right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb but in spite
All of the bullshit, we on our back starin' at the stars above
Talkin' 'bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong
I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show
That I would one day see her standin' in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper
It's like that now, you better go, get the hump, up out your back now
It's about four, five cats off in my 'Llac now
We just shoot, game in the form of story rap now, yeah
It's like that now, it's like that now

I call da crib they say "Breeze you ain't know?"
I say "What?" "Big Time got popped in his Benzo!"
I said "Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell em da money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talkin 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in... naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who us a dime
It's the Great Hoe Round Up Yo' Money time
I got to HAVE MINE, then I'm OUTTA HERE
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry bout yo' potnah gettin caught like a lame
It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang"
(It won't be over till that big girl from Decatur sang!
East Pointe police don't know a damn thang...)
Verse Two: Big Boi
Yeah, it won't be over
Check this out
Can you see what I be hearin talkin to spirits when I sleep
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
about that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Lookin up in your face I see a coward and a dimwit
Lookin to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Servin a warrant to a baby daddy, who do they come to quote?
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slippin
Leavin the keys off in the ignition, makin me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers tryin to stack for ninety-six
Buyin another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
Cause them niggaz at the corner sto' been lookin at me for too long
Starin like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin
Y'all don't know nothin bout Big Boi cause that nigga steady dippin
It ain't over (why that, why that) till the bitch open her mouth up
and sang...
Verse Three: Big Gipp
Took me a long time to get here
Long time man
I'm talkin about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holdin bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you posed to get paid?
Niggaz walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumpin Lily, to lilypad dad
Lookin to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men
Who'd stop dem or would stop
I'm droppin lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started to dream
It's ninety-six I'm in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream?

 <SONGSTART> You're all I've ever wanted, but I'm terrified of you
Sick my castle may be haunted, but I'm terrified of you
I've cast my spell on millions, but I'm terrified of you
Baby I do this from the ceiling, but I'm terrified of you
I'll wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened oh! Dracula's wedding
I've never ran from no one, but I'm terrified of you
See my heartbeat is a slow one, but I'm terrified of you
I've been around for ages, but I'm terrified of you
Put my fang across the stage, but yet I'm terrified of you
I'll wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened oh! Dracula's wedding
You know I'm terrified
You know I'm terrified
You know I'm terrified
Give me the chance to dance romance
Don't run, I'm not the sun
So much at stake, oh! Bad choice of words
But I'm not the gun shot
With silver bullets and I can count
Plus I make great peanut butter
And jelly sandwiches Van Helsing

Peep what I say
Everyday--the sun sets just like clockwork
Put the glock to work
And puttin the body to standstlls
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss--niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue--cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me--thinking that all these niggas
See they fly shit--thinking they steven segall an
Balling--falling to the wayside when ya try to call
I've fallen--when we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
They get the tecs to flex--like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing no-no--not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit--we done a bunch of shit
And yes ya heard of this--out of this world like E.T.
Coming across ya T.V.
Extraterrestrial--straight from ATL.
(Know what I'm saying--Like that--Yeah)
Chorus:
Out of this world
Are you alien?
(repeat 3x)
Out of this world...
Andre:
Right now I'm smiling
Taking advantage of this moment
Cause there might not be another soon
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars
tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker--But to you
I may appear to be your average joe
But little do you know
that even joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life
Despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch--that being heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why?--Cause in a sense
See we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings
Head to better things
Maybe the mockingbird and nightengale
they want to sing--keeping this thing alive
To the table's what we bring
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring
Extraterrestrial
(Out of this world--Things like that--Yo)

 <SONGSTART> One, one, one for the money, yes
One, one, one for the money, yes
One, one, one for the money yes, uhh, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin' ta find that hookup
Now, everyday we look up at the ceilin'
Watchin' ceilin' fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin'
Off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writin' rhymes tryin' ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin' the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin' the crowd move but we not makin' no G's
And that's a nono
Yeah, uhh, check it, ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggaz
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin' the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin'
Niggaz say motherfuck that playin', they payin'
We stay in layin' vocals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea, dem niggaz they makin' big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggaz they take it lightly
Ninety six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
Around this bitch
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
Back in the day when I was younger, hunger
Lookin' to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullshit, pull shit
Off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was, stoned like white boys
Smokin' them white golds before them blunts got krunk, chunky asses
Passes gettin' thrown like Hail Mary's and they lookin' like Halle Berry
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sippin' wine
We's just chillin', I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smokin' freely, me Lil B, Greet, Mon and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick, and mama I'm suckin' dick, now
We movin' on up in da world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eighty two
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone, yeah, yeah
Like this Eastpointe and we gone
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
Got stopped at the mall the other day, heard a call from the other way
That I just came from, some nigga was sayin' somethin'
Talkin bout "Hey man, you remember me from school?"
Naw not really but he kept smilin' like a clown
Facial expression lookin' silly
And he kept askin' me, "What kind of car you drive? I know you paid
I know y'all got buku of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been goin through tha same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you don't move yo' foot then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them Slim ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon stop so we just gonna continue
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too

Rollin' down the strip on vogues

 <SONGSTART> Andre:
Now sittin' in the bathtub listening to the Isley
Brothers and others outside my door want to despise me
Reminds me that everyone ain't cool the world is jealous
Never could understand when my momma use to tell us
"Don't take your food outside around your friends
Unless you got enough to feed the neighborhood"
The play has just began, follow me now
Act 1 scene 2 the date 1/1/96 the time I don't know
Mood disturbed, Ray goes on to say they trying to get over
Like them niggas with the blinker on, I got my thinker on
So I'm like word, How every you want to act is fine
That is real as fishing raw I might be kissing God
But I'm still in the bathtub so if you got cattle you best be fasting
For 7 days and 7 nights we everlasting
? on a quest to get my class ring just from them fhite wolks
I will if it's the last thing
I do
Hook:
Everlasting
talking:
Yeah, slick knowhatI'msayin'? I'm gonna tell you like this. Just cause I

windshield I tell you shortie gonna bust your ass about that shit.
Big Boi:
Hey y'all hey y'all hey y'all hoes
Back up in this bitch rippin' tracks like I'm suppose
Tommy and Ralph Lauren don't like niggas to wear they clothes
Where your proof at? Who's that? Talking shit like those
Keepin' the rumors up, I wish I lived in a fuckin' cage
I ride the streets in Lexus all these hoes wanna be saved
Go to college get a job because all you want to do is shake
I use to hit club niggas but I gave taht shit a break
Just like Maaco, Waco, burn it to the ground
I bet you eatin' pork when your partners ain't around
Backdraft things are Shaft slapping these hoes
Just like he's suppose to, quote you
"Big Boi is the pimp ass nigga that formed you"
Like pottery, sloppily playin' hoes the lotteries
OutKast did the dirt and now you swear your shit is poppin' see You bit
beats, we makin' hits so give me your flag back
I'm living in the SWATS so you may call me Daddy Fatsack
Yeah you know what I'm sayin'? Like this. Everlasting
Hook
Big Boi:
One in a million men passing the J off in the culture
Don't y'all smoke a couple of pounds and get tore up y'all
And tear the devil headquarter down to the grizzound
Is how we hti house and puff a couple of good pounds
Of good weed, PeeWee, my nigga Little Beewee
We need a 50 box of Phillies and some bouncin' titties
From the magic the flame niggas too is sharin' sequals
Never payin' for no pussy
You can shake it you can keep it to your self hoe
Andre:
You left your morals at the door, when you steeped in crept in
Nigga this baby is at the beach so now you wondering
Why your nigga done bust you in the fore, head
Ain't no respect there so you just assed out like breech
Delivery slivery got you swung on these types of things
Go on from here to Bornhome to London
England, Wall Street to y'all street
Sometime I get bewildered and it throws a nigga like me off beat
But I'm back on it
Because we last forever sound good don't it?
Rattling in your trunks like Fambu and the component
Said that's it, man fuck that shit
On and on and on and I'm out
Hook
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Big Boi:
Peep what I say
Everyday--the sun sets just like clockwork
Put the glock to work
And puttin the body to standstlls
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss--niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue--cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me--thinking that all these niggas
See they fly shit--thinking they steven segall an
Balling--falling to the wayside when ya try to call
I've fallen--when we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
They get the tecs to flex--like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing no-no--not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit--we done a bunch of shit
And yes ya heard of this--out of this world like E.T.
Coming across ya T.V.
Extraterrestrial--straight from ATL.
(Know what I'm saying--Like that--Yeah)
Chorus:
Out of this world
Are you alien?
(repeat 3x)
Out of this world...
Andre:
Right now I'm smiling
Taking advantage of this moment
Cause there might not be another soon
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars
tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker--But to you
I may appear to be your average joe
But little do you know
that even joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life
Despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch--that being heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why?--Cause in a sense
See we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings
Head to better things
Maybe the mockingbird and nightengale
they want to sing--keeping this thing alive
To the table's what we bring
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring
Extraterrestrial
(Out of this world--Things like that--Yo)

You got red dirt in your Afro
(Young Hov' in the place to be) (yeah)
(Outkast in the place to be) (yeah)
Did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block
Didn't have to break a steerin' column, didn't have to cook a rock
A damn goodie two-shoes, that what they call ya
Never judge a person or a book by it's covers
Just because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner
You never took the time out, examine yourself Boi
Are you black, white, asian?
Indonesian, or Borean-that's black and Korean
We on the same team if we breathin'
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seein'
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that P.A. sticker on it cause they scared we gon' curse
But the knowledge is the power, the cowards get devoured
Any hour, any cipher, any way to any height
Because I might just snap on a Fuck-ass nigga
Might clap a cap at a sucker-ass nigga
In the meantime, Daddy Fat sacks gon' chill out
He might just, pull out his pistol
And let that thing whistle at your windshield or your residence
Superman to Clark Kent, you better be way harded
Than the park bench to start this
Marcus, Jason, my little brother James
All my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same
Ain't no uno, we a duo; deuce dos to a pair
A player stiffen the competition
Pressed like Levi's toughskins, on minus one
Negative one minus negative one is nothin
Bustin' d-boy raps and player poems
The "Kast shit ain't plastic, we smash it and move the crowd
And rock the crowd original material while you bore 'em
Your life show consists of eveybody's shit but you're-uns
Do you own shit! In your life show (bitin ass nigga)
Young Hov' in the place to be
Big Boi in the place to be (Young)
Andre 3000 (cash) shout out to public housing (bitch)
I brought (holla) the whole hood with me (yeah, yeah)
Young Hov' in the place to be

Andre 3000 (cash) shout out to public housing (bitch)
I brought (hollo) the whole hood with me (yeah, yeah)
Penelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze
With her Eye's Wide Shut, before I ashed to hit her gut
If you brunette, Legally Blonde, I might respond
Take you to Swan Lake, and beyond
Antwan raps on, raps on, clap off clop on
I switch the flow so quick you cannot fa-thom
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea
And try to grab one line or sentence
Rhyme repentance, find the illest lyricist
And give him a clean bill of health
Wealth might make you look good but you should like shit
And your team
My nigga Big Boi said "Watch 'em as they gawk and they gander
You can follow or lead like Commander Picard
You can have The Whole World
Or be satisfied with the boulevard, over stand
This young player's rhyme
I foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme
Focused on every word, and line
Like a young Cassius Clay in this prime
I was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm
The epitome of raw rhyme
Got signed, got serious about the craft
Of raw rhyme and I got mine, Aquemini's
Murderous monster move minds
Did it so hard that it oughta be a crime
When you see I'm comin' holla one-time, holla one-time
When you see I'm comin' holla one-time (one-time)
Don't, you, like, to groove
In your hooptie on your old, flip, flop, sweatshoes
To run yo' tennis shoes
Don't, it, matter to you
That Outkast we got that slump for y'all
Keep that funk for y'all
When I'm in the mood I rock the S Dot tennis shoes
At the interlude, I got the Gucci flip-flops
And I, fix it up like gin and juice when I'm them interviews
Dudes want to know what he copped
And where you got that, and how could they buy that
Where the million dollar watch at, stop that!
Why that, why this, niggas want to hijack the flyness
I'm on a whole 'nother plane
A whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin'
Understand what I'm sayin'
Hov' and Outkast, what you think about that?
Really don't matter though what you niggas chatter though
Anybody get out of line then you trust
That the mac'll go are-are-are-are-rap, got you killed for that alone
Back on the shit back on the strip
Another hit I'm not goin' miss

 <SONGSTART> Verse 1: (andre 3000)
hello, well good evening ladies and gentleman
what we like to do right here, well first of all
let me let you know who I am
well, I go by the name of andre 3000, right
and we hail from a little place called stankonia, GA, right
you know right now everyone wants to be from space
and like want to be from the country and everything like that
you know, like really like the south is like
it's cool to be from the south right about now, girls listen up
torn between saturday night and early sunday morn
I dont know I'm somewhere stuck in between, tween
I'm out here knowing hip hop is dead
the average nigga on my corner yelling, what the fuck you mean, mean
see we ain't even seen, the mountain top counter clock
wise goes the neighborhood hand me down and canned goods
won't cut the gray poupon we got that make you run
back to the drawing board can't afford to lose y'all, make me yawn
one slash one slash ninety-one
my teacher sees potential in me, says sit down son
now let me tell you like I heard it, when I felt deserted
it wasn't no other way to word it got my feelings murdered
by the the bullet of bad the singer of sad
songs to make you long for your mum and your dad
plaid clash with polka dots I hope you ain't mad
back up little mama I'm about to react
Chorus 1: (andre 3000)
yep, we ain't just funkin around nope, you dont want to see me clown nope
tomorrow sounds like right now
(sleepy brown)
people have your party and please dont be late
it's time to bounce, rock, roller skate, bounce, rock, roller skate
hey sex mama there's no time to waste,
it's time to bounce, rock, roller skate, bounce, rock, roller skate
grab your partner, roll around, and feel the sound ah baby
people have your party, don't be late
it's time to bounce, rock, roller skate
Verse 2: (big boi)
well scotty, is beaming, lil' pookie 'nem scheming
what's the use in living my nigga, while you snoozing, I'm dreaming
no tylenol PM, you amount to the same thing, everyday like per diem
never trying to be nothing, better than you are being
one nation under the cool, should be the rule
when a young man or a young lady begins or starts grade school
silence before violence, nine times out of ten times
the quietest is the livest, fumbling through your privates
daddy fat sax can I have you back, naw!
ooh! you such a player, ooh! your southern drawl
got me sprawled out, in your black book my name was crossed out
went from starting second string, now you in the dog house
reminiscin', a part of you was missing
instead of arguments you think about the hugs and kisses
if this is something hard for you to take
you better, bounce, rock, roller skate
(chorus)

On this funky ride, so just relax baby

Well burn motherfucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for your slice of life I'm tellin' ya why?
I hear that mother nature's now on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go
All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga round me playin' married
Or payin' child support
I can't cope
Never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport
Pray I live to see the day when seven's happily married
With kids, woe woe
The world is movin' fast and I'm losin' my balance
No time to dig, low, low
To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up
Ya wit me say shit, sho sho
Now let me ask y'all this
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn motherfucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for your slice of life I'm tellin' ya why?
I hear that mother nature's now on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go
It's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing fed time
On a first offense drug bust, fuck the holice
That's if ya racist or ya crooked
Arrest me for this dope I didn't weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world cause over a million people took it
Look at me, you outta your jurisdiction now ya lookin' stupid
Officer, get off me sir
Don't make me call L.A. he'll have ya walking sir
A couple of months ago they gave outkast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity
About the youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law
They think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage we scream
Don't everybody, everybody
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn motherfucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for your slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that mother nature's now on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Officer of the most high you touch me you touch the apple of this eye
If they kick us out where will we go
Not to Africa 'cause not one of them acknowledge us as they kin folk
Still eatin' pork, abomination, desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on judgement day
Hip hip hooray, Mr. Reaper Babylon the great
The mother of heartless is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled
The liquor fire is calling
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn motherfucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for your slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that mother nature's now on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

Locked up, no possibility of getting out
Because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears and my peers

 <SONGSTART> Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't spend all your time tryin' to get high
You need git up, git out and git somethin'
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
'Cuz you and I got to do for you and I
I don't recall, ever graduation at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asked to give me some livin' life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon' do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though
(Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be ingested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I
Get high but I don't get too high, so what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
And what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know somethin' I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
'Cuz every job I get is cruel and demeanin'
Sick of takin' trash out and toilet bowl cleanin'
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin'
I never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smugglin'
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-lo will just continue travelin' this route without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't spend all your time tryin' to get high
Nigga you need git up, git out and git somethin'
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
'Cuz you and I got to do for you and I
Well, uh, git up, stand up, so what's said, you dick head
See when I was a youngsta, used to wear them fuckin' Pro Keds
My mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggaz for they fuckin' starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb
I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch
You need to git up, git out, git somethin'
Smoke out, 'cuz it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sportin plats and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cuz the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, 'cuz they raised me
I'm also down with La Face 'cuz L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool yeah, it's real cool, gettin' paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't spend all your time tryin' to get high
Nigga you need git up, git out and git somethin'
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
'Cuz you and I got to do for you and I
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and dem spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm gettin' paranoid and steady lookin' for the time
It's eight in the mornin' and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm diggin' through the ash tray, hopin' to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git somethin')
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Se-Dan DeVille, steady bouncin'
Out the Pointe to Cambelton Road
The valley of the South side flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow
So keep your eyes peeled for the 'cover unit
'Cause they known for jumpin' out of black Chevy trucks
And through the fog, here come the Red Dogs
I'm bustin' out around the corner in my hog
Dippin' from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
'Cuz I have no time for jail, fuck Clampett cops, fuck Elgin' Bail
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinkin' that my city is the big lick for 96
94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, Outkast, a vision from the past
Hootie hoo my white owls are burnin' kinda slow
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't spend all your time tryin' to get high
Nigga you need git up, git out and git somethin'
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'
'Cuz you and I got to do for you and I
Y'all tellin' me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody black runnin' but crackers, so why I got to register?
I thinkin' of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way back to
When a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta
Y'all could not tell me nuthin', thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start workin' at the loadin' dock
They layin' my mama off of work, General Motors trippin'
But I come home Bank like Hank, from lickin' and dippin'
Doin' dumb shit, not knowin' what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin' a fool
Wastin' my time in the school, I'd rather be shootin' pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about mackin' hoes and wearin' pimp fade
Instead of bein' in a class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinkin' about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up I shoulda listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talkin' yin-yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missin' the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feelin' broke and shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an OUT-Kast
So get up off your ass
Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git somethin'
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git somethin'

She doesn't even have to have a big ol' ass
Something well proportioned to her body
You know a nice lil' tail you know

 <SONGSTART> My name is Cupid Valentino
The modern day cupid
And I just want to say one thing
Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th
I don't think ya'll heard me
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th
Can ya'll dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate
See cupid grabs the pistol
Now look here
He shoots straight for your heart
Now and he won't miss you
But that's alright
Ya'll won't believe in me anyway but
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Leprechauns or ground hogs
No thank you Easter Bunny
There's all this talk about Santa Claus
But see love will rule supreme
Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th
You got it
When cupid knocks at your door
You can't ignore me
There's no need to run
So Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th
Now I may have it all wrong, you see
If you know what love means, well
Somebody tell me
'Cuz, they just don't believe in me
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Leprechauns or ground hogs
No thank you Easter Bunny
There's so much fuss about Santa Claus
But see cupid will not be defeated
Happy Valentine's day
Every day the 14th
Now I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me, now I understand
'Cause I used to be a bad boy in my day
I know your tryin' to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Hey don't you suppose to be
Some kind of player or somethin', Bunny
Well keep on running player
'Cuz I've got my good shoes on
And I got them tied up tight
So you're gonna find out, tonight
Got a sweet lil' darling back in my corner
Below I know I love her but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I'd give up my heart
But never know because shit I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling I'd holla that it's irrel'
I don't get myself caught up in the jello jella
And pudding pops that other opt to call falling in love
But for the record have you ever rode a horse?
Likely you just sent me to Pluto, I said of course
But if you ain't a sweety indeedy I won't endorse
Han Solo till I'm hit by bullets, obey the force
Bewitch you and I rich you in better time permits
For now show me samples, examples why your the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so

But can't stand to see me walk out the door
Don't try to fight the feeling
Because the thought alone is killin' me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it when there's nothin' at all
We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
Know what they say -its:
Nothing lasts forever!
Then what makes it, then what makes it
Then what makes it, then what makes it
Then what makes love the exception?
So why, oh, why, oh
Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh
Are we still in denial when we know we're not happy here
Hey ya! (y'all don't want to here me, ya just want to dance) Hey ya!

Ooooh, yeeeeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Big Boi]
Yeah yeah uh
Been always told to keep my head up
But three shakes just don't cut the cake when your necktie from bobbing
Life's a stage, street's the cage,
we dungeon rats Outkast and Goodie Mobbin
Enough of the petite talk, I'd rather have a nigga with a perm
Ain't got to have punk, on my side than a nigga who frontin
To another nigga's interpretation of god-stuntin
(?) Why both a president'll be a swat guy
That's like choosing which bullet you gon' get shot by
A drank and some hot fries
Slowly eating me up from inside to outside
Well you gon' die anyway, right? Wrong
I plan to live forever, I know it seems mighty long
If you think about it in Earth terms
Thank god we on the TV what we let like earthworms
Stay underground like (?) or Dig Dug
Only come above to shake hands and give hugs
Lay your beautiful body down on this fur rug
You got to give a damn if you do not give a fuck, ha!
Rack 'em up 'cuz we bustin'
Once was the nigga in the back of the class who never said nothing
His thought became an amplifier
I live for inspiration, for without that, I will die (go!)
Here the bomb jam now can you dig it?
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Here the bomb jam now can you dig it?
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh

[Slim Cutta-Calhoun]
Got issues on my mind like a fool from Columbine
Will I swallow my pride or take that ride?
Better think before my cock get slide and take a dive
Into this hot pit like ball of grease
Stand alone on my own ten toes against foes
It's a snowstorm and you outside gettin' cold
Luck has struck one buck for seven every roll
Throwin' snake eyes thinkin' a nigga gon' fold
Stand down like four black vogues on goes
Snatchin' all the dough and leavin' y'all broke
Going all out for an A plus in class
I bust ass walkin' barefoot over broken glass
Now who gon' pass player? You won't last
See we all in the race just taking up space
If we's on the other side of the track grab the straps
Thought y'all knew wild off runnin' past
So who you think you foolin? We can get to dueling
On some old school shit, like we high schoolin'
There he is!
Get him!
(Don't run! Don't run!)
Yeah, sucker! What'cha gon' do now? What'cha gon' do now sucker?
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it

Let me walk you little kiddies through my school days
Sunday night I hit a party, missed a Monday, I'll go Tuesday
Doomsday, homeroom was lookin' beauty
The girl I wanna cut is absent but I see a cutie
But bump a flirt, I need to be doin' this homework to graduate
Saturate my body and memory on some algebrate
Bro, why you holdin' and totin' that's to assassinate
Go masturbate you jack-off, nigga take the hat off
I'm a third year freshman, I started with the best of them
But now them niggas done passed me, I'm just a baby daddy
O.G. Original Goofball, and I used to slang the hard heart
And smoke the soft softball saw through the way-hall
Niggas up in the school, they know my name, look!
But that's because my face is in like eight different yearbooks
Could've been took the S.A.T. but the streets got the best of me
Thinkin' and drinkin' and bankin' open while like sesame
All tellin' me to chill out (chill out!)
before you be a drop out (chill out!)
Or cop out, is when you're thirty-something at your mom's house, yeah
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it

Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce
And I'm a star
Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood wit cameras on
I really think they stealin' from us like a sampled song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like hammers home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a durn country song
This whole country wrong, oh but you right
If you just put a little ice on and cut ya mic on
But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant cobra
I'm so not sober, I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller
Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it? uh, bling bling I know
And did you know I'm the creator of the term
"I just straightened the perm"?
They let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle but they urn
Like a dead body burned on the mantelpiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like it's candle grease
And I be's the little nigga, cooler than antifreeze
Defrost on your window pane, Lil' Wayne
But in Hollywood it's "Little" Wayne
It don't make me numb, so that's why I got a prenumb
I do
Starts off like a small-town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce
A is for Adamsville, B is for Bowen Home
C if I give a fuck, if you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep comin' back, three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your undivided attention
I'm gonna say this and run, under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three-fourth of it all
For what? So your kid's kid's kids can have some cheese
Can't get wit it? Git git, git git, git on your knees
'Cause wealth is the word, riches 'round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write, shoot me a bird
Tenth grade, the way was paved for me and Dre to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein of arts and crafts
Now could we make a-a-a difference?
Antwan Patton and AndrÃ© Benjamin
Been jammin' for you cabin rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
- The Sequel, all new cast just ain't the same gang
Of nerds on the internet slandering your name
Behind that screen name they're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&s with no nuts won't show up face to face
Straight bitch-made like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryna plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen? Nigga please
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes, must be something bigger waiting
Starts off like a small-town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce
I do love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there
And me and you together baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walk a thin line
Others say they got you, but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all the cat fights
Domestic violence, is that right?
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm goin' up, showin' up, blowin' up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me, like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy, straight cut out and left me
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good lil' hood thang
Look at Blues, Rock, Jazz, Rap
Not even talkin' about music, everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool, we just keep it goin', make new shit
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame and then they kick us to the curb

Hootie Hoo
Follow the funk from the skunk
and the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon
It goes on and on and on, like that
Goin out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'llac
Ah suki, suki
All day and day, any day, every damn day
I be thinkin about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to slang a fat rock, but now I'm servin hemp
I never even smoked a gram of crack, but yo I'm dope
Mo' doper than a junkie or a Pooky cause it's on
So each one, teach one, I be claimin true
To East Pointe and College Park and the things I used to do
Around ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers
Club Nikki's, Magic City and them Southern playas
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya
So Hallelujah, Hallelujah
One for the playas at the crib, drinking drinks
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make
chorus:
Hootie Hoo
Tight like hallways, smoked out always(Hootie Hoo)
Yeah, Hootie Hoo
Big Boi on the left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)
[Andre Benjamin]
Now playin these bitches is my favorite sport
But ain't no game when they be callin your name in the court
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight
That it's bustin out the seems, yes sir, I'm set
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light(Hootie Hoo)
Communication device dun went off twice
Should I answer the call, yes, I'm mackin 'em all
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball
Well, it's Player's Ball 2, so I guess I'll call you
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through
Now later on done got here
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?
Draws, fallin down like niggaz in a drive-by
I got up in them hoes and I told 'em bye bye
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit
Talkin 'bout her period late, guess what I did
Click
Naw, it couldn't be me. Not me
chorus(2X)
[Big Boi]
Uh, well you know we gettin blizzard cuz we got that chicken gizzard
In the dungeon and scope but some of you niggaz can't cope with it
So, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park
So got on Martino, it's Outkast for the 94 era
You heard the player's call, we takin it to another level
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martel
And you may go to hell
[Andre Benjamin]
Set sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is
It's that Southern ses in your chest that is
One mo' gen for my friend who don't take
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will pay you
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you
Down like some bo-los, you can throw those
Head, til I'm dead, yes, it's now your broke hoes
Don't get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit
But if you fall in this category, then youse a bitch
chorus(4X)
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I stank I can, I stank I can
The funky engine that could
Yowsky, wowsky, pisky, wisky
All aboard the Stankonia Express
The underground smell road
Everybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose
What's your locomotive
The chatta nigga choo choo?
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard, I'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't happen like it's suppose to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger, live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga? Start from ya corner
Everything don't always happen like you planned it
Demand it, over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching, why you quitting 'cause it's heated in the kitchen?
Stop ya slipping and ya pimping nigga
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
You've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams
No weapon formed against prospers 54: 17
From Isaiah lay a nigga down and spray 'em
If the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Yeah, too democratic, republic fuck it
We chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dollar and wipe my ass wit it
You livin' for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her drawers
She said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol
I said, "Oh hell naw!" But yet it's that too
You can't discrimi-hate 'cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope, saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it?
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision
Do you wanna live or wanna exist?
The game changes every day so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
I'm wild just like a rock, a stone, a tree
I'm free just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die just like a flower plucked
And dragged away is thrown away and then one day it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays until the rain and sun
Then I breathe just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding
It's beautiful, that's life and that's life
And that's life and that's life
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've gotta re-route my dreams
Y'all can't harm me, it's over

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin uh.
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fine
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin
To look sexy, but even if she was so what
Mother f**ker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that lets me, know that she's a human being
And being human's hard, on the boulevard
Girl you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact
You hoped to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced us at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the southern states, you know where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes you're getting booed if your shit does not get down
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks, what's in your +Speakerboxxx+
+Pink and Blue+, you're lolly gaggin, you're slow pokin
You got me open, you're playin wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if Anita Baker bring's the joy, you're kinder, the Tyner meanin the real McCoy
I can't wait.

Ooo its been too long now baby

Sir Lucious is the real deal, but even he gets ancy
Some honeys try to +Kill Bill+ beneath the underpants see
But patience is a virtue, being anxious just might hurt you
Like Mike Vick returning to the line of scrimmage too soon
A line of nigga's tryin' get in *VISIONS* on a full moon
Should I play it cool, or be the one to make the first move?
Anticipatin, and contemplatin, she got you sprung dude
Shit, I'm fittin to get her might emit her, what you gone do? (wha?)
I tell you what, we wont be fallin for that one, two
Just kinky sex up off in the boom boom if she want to
And if she don't, then I'll dial another date
That means find another face to replace, 'cause I can't wait

Boy you know I pu-pu-put it, down boy I pu-pu-put It down
I used to rub on your back and kiss all up on your neck but what do I get in return
You ain't gon learn till I leave your ass and I won't come back
Stop playin with little boys and find myself a real man
Want to leave so bad but I'm holding back
I'm goin blaze another blunt until I get some senncess
()
So I'm about to roll me a blunt
About to freak up a mild get
You up off my chest the only way I know how
I'm getting geeked for tonight girl
Gone and pass me the light
I need to inhale exhale boy you got me smokin, smokin, smokin, smokin
Boy you no good for me you making me want to leave but I can't seem to walk away

 <SONGSTART> Nigga, quit being so goddamn selfish
Put it in ya pelvis
Let it work, gyrate, motivate
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
No, after you
Oh, thank you, Lord for throwing some shy
Bones in my body let me tell you why
If not so, I'd be too, too bad
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is Dre
But you can call me Possum Allawishes Jenkins
Andre 3000 for short
And naaw, I don't want to see your thongs
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
(And I will pause for your cause)
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
No, after you
I'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul and then I'm a get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court until we give out
Do you take it all or spit it out, are you faking the funk and living a lie?
Do you really know what it feels like to have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn but now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I pretty d'd you
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
No, after you
Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo
Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady
Wit a reputation known for sexing niggas 'til they crazy
Whatcha mean dog, telling a play like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking you for fun
Join the bandwagon nigga, it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars
Hitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all
Groupie, you need to be glad you even knew me
Do me and tell all my friends my truly blew me, bitch
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
No, after you
Nigga, you better dial 404-485, well bump all that
But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cut shot white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to idle wishes
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game but you should called before you came
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
No, after you
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come, I won't just pop over, out the blue
No, after you

[Chorus]
You just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll never get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things go slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I ow
In due time
[Verse One:]
When that * be thinkin of cruisin'
The Braves cap is to the side
Thinkin' the police gon' pull me over
With this * off in my ride
So I hide the brick of weed
Under the arm rest, under the leather
Thinkin' of startin ways
To make my life a little better
Then the dope peddler
Never pay no * taxes
Takin a chunk up out my check
And makin my rhymes just look like practice
Buyin' clothing, Range Roving
With my folks
Don't speak about the Dirty South
My crew ain't bout no jokes
I know some people don't like the way we flow
Because they envy
They talkin bout they * my *
And that they could have been me
You lookin to be that butterfly
Without the caterpillar
Take your time and do it right
Cause you gon make it
I swear my
Or collapse 1
Falling a victim to your greed boy
Your looking to be Big Willie
But ou're still a seed boy
The information in my skull
Be pokin' some of ya'll on the shoulder
But on the other side of the fence
They got * breakin' boulders
For quick money
[Bridge]
Struggle is just a part of my day
Many obstachave been placed in my way
I know the only reason that I make it through
Is because I never stop believing in you
Some people wonder why we're here in the 1st place
They can't believe because they ain't never seen your face
But even when you pray, the next day you gotta try
Can it wait 4 nobody 2 come down out the sky
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let him do the rest
You've got your life, you've got your health
So quit procrastinating and push it yourself
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let him do the rest
You've got your life, you've got your health
So quit procrastinating
[Verse 2:]
Who said good folks is not supposed to die
The same * that said * is not supposed to cry
United States giving out milk and cheese to pacify
I'm sure they got a cure 4 A.I.D.S., but yet it's classified
You wonder why I spit the truth and not 2 make no dough
To make a differencefo' this * up and blow
In piece, I could thinkof many reasons
Only when * is going bad you want to holla Jesus
I pledge allegiance, they got my knuckles bleeding
From crawling, got these * thinkin they ballin'
When they isn't, don't take my word,
there's * off in prison
That will tell yo, that's locked up 4 a long time and won't sell you
No flex, so congregation will turn you text,
To the book of OutKast, chapter 2, verse 1
The 1st 1, that make me jump up and make a joyful noise
You'se OutKasted, meaning you now have a choice like that

Motherfucker, pow pow! Lay the fuck down now
Now naw, don't try and talk your way out
Because I'm usually non-violent, positively vibin'
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try ya
Why? I don't know, I don't even understand it

Keep lookin' at me with a gangster grill
And I'm gonna give yo' ass a gangster spill
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigger ain't live, that nigger there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleepin' with the fishes
Done like dishes, it's a wrap like Christmas

I will bust they motherfuckin' head

Had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin' around my crew lookin Jazzy, wanna pretend

Well here's a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly, like in 'Living Color"'s Wanda, word up
Well everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb
And fall victim, I will overcome any hurdle
Or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort
So make it last for the risk you took
Trick, you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels
And a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards
All you got in the refrigerator is Bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge
And enjoy the finer things in life right? yah
Your dignity, your only sacrifice
Slim as your chances of being somebody's wife
They seeing ya butt, booty naked every night
Ain't nothing right or wrong

Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high
(From this point on it only gets rougher)
Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda
Now she's out of a job, she would slob on a knob
For a little less than a yard
A massage you could drill her like a sarge
She would charge and rob
Pick through yo' pockets
She got the tricks watcha and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license
On the night stand fuckin' with this white man
She met in a little red Corvette paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forget you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction
Therefore everything that goes around
Comes around in that fashion
Fast and furiously
The was a knock on the sliding glass door
Bitch it's me
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick
But you slipped now I'm getting in your shit
Brothers on the block knowing

In the land of a million drums
there is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home
[Big Boi]
In the land of a million drums
I catch a pattern that spit rings around you like Saturn
Intergalatic tracks I make 'em like magstrulium
This one for scooby, pass the doobie imma do me one, do me one
Only you clean over
I pick up the mic and rock it while I'm sober
For the rated G exposure if you listen what I'm tryin to told ya
We fathers with seeds of our own
We're talkin about sons and daughters boy, not roots and clones
Now that the theory gone wrong
An embryo with no soul
Stuck in this green mini-van with my lungs in a chokehold
Shaggy pass the boombastic
Daphne said don't do that
Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic
Now Scrappy wanna box and throw them bows
so I had to sic the pitbull on him before he could pass one blow
Scooby-doo, scooby-doo, scooby damn doo, scooby doo (Scooby doobie doo)
[Chorus]
[Killer Mike]
Woke up from a long night of hanging out with Shaggy
Oh no, lost my last baggy of scoobie snackies
Shaggy wake up, we've been had
Our scooby snacks they got the whole stash
He said, who who, I don't have a clue
I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scooby Doo
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
Tell him to send another package right through the mail
In the meantime, I'mma call Velma to tell her
To get the Mystery Machine ready
I'm two-wayin Daphne and Freddy
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped
Dippin through the flash tryin to get our stash back
Roundin up suspects, collecton' clues
I got a question, where the hell is Scooby Doo when you need em?
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
Tell him holler back
[Chorus]
[Andre 3000]
Break it down, break it down baby 'til the flow jumps off the ground
Ooo break it down lookin' over yonder til the walls come tumblin down
Ooo, yes lord y'ain't gotta tell me two times but you know I know
Ooo, break it down, break it down baby 'cuz I want y'all all to know
We rock the world
[Chorus]
I coulda got away with it, if it wasn't for ya meddlin kids

I'm the coolest nigga ain't gon' spend mo than a dub
I'll go tell them broads and they Chickenhead friends
No Ferrari, no Jag, no Bentley or no Benz
Might just play the wall with this mean look on my grill
Act like I'm hate of the haitian from Hateville
I remember her, act like she don't remember me
When I was cadillac coupe de villin' Chickenhead drillin'
To them niggaz that be holding the wall
Hit the flo, start shaking it off

To them muthafuckaz that be holding the wall
Hit the flo, start shaking it off
What we dranking? We dranking it all
We gon' do it 'till we can't or we fall, last call
I'm gon' get that fresh fire fade and then I'm gon' get laid
Like some finger waves on payday, my lady you won't get paid
Making an early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol make a fast call for the hay
The dirty doctor has informed me, the drought has ended today
With no delay and four piece brizzle
We on our ay for a brief stay at a sweet place with a petite face to play
To them niggaz that be holding the wall
Hit the flo, start shaking it off
What we dranking? We dranking it all
We gon' do it 'till we can't or we fall, last call
To them muthafuckaz that be holding the wall
Hit the flo, start shaking it off
What we dranking? We dranking it all
We gon' do it 'till we can't or we fall, last call
Them boys something wild, don't crack no smile
Closet like the wild kingdom, fox, minks to crocodiles
Pop tops on what we drink, so sit back for a while
Matter of fact, light that and I'll be right back
They want a couple more bottles
I got somthin' for 'em to swallow
Anybody ever told you you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit, the hook, line, the follow
I got my hooks in the back and I'm gonna grind until tomorrow
They call me mack rap-a-licious
And when I bubble I blow trouble up in your ear
They call me mack rap-a-licious
And when I bubble it's trouble all up in your dear
To them niggaz that be holding the wall
Hit the flo, start shaking it off
What we dranking? We dranking it all
We gon' do it 'till we can't or we fall, last call
To them muthafuckaz that be holding the wall
Hit the flo, start shaking it off
What we dranking? We dranking it all
We gon' do it 'till we can't or we fall, last call
Yes, I know what excite them hoes
Mink coats, reptilian feet, bite them hoes
Got a partner on his mind sick
He say he love this old coke strung out stripper bitch
Why he so dumb?
I'm so pimp it's ridiculous
Got tinted on my windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous
Ride with this pretty thang
She ain't yours she wish you was
We don't stop and it's so repeated and continuous
Mello caponne, don huggy bear
Pokey the fuckin' pimpolous ain't that cute
But slick 'em out them drawers
I'm so infamous, dead serious
From the club to the caddy to the Holiday Inn
From the dust to the dawn we gon' do it again
To them niggaz that be holding the wall
Hit the flo, start shaking it off
What we dranking? We dranking it all
We gon' do it 'till we can't or we fall, last call

Too late to pray that I'm on it.

And there's a fine line between love and hate you see
Came way too late, but baby I'm on it.
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see
Came way too late, but baby I'm on it.
Can't worry bout, what a nigga think now see
That's Liberation and baby I want it.
Can't worry bout, what anotha nigga think
Now that's Liberation and baby I want it.
(Let me hear it, let me hear it, let me hear those, let me hear those)
How many times I, sit back and contemplate
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm tellin my story.
My relationship, with my folks is give and take
And I done took so much, not givin my glory
Now have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left uppa to me, and my momma n'em told me (yes she did)
I said I have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left uppa to me, and my momma n'em told me
No, nooo, noooooooo
I'm so tired, it's been so long - struggling, hopelessly
Seven and forty days. heyyy
Ohhhh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe
To make you believe, I'd give my life awayyyy
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my owwwwn
All on my owwwwn, weeeeeee.
We alive or we ain't livin, that's why I'm givin until it's gone
Cause I don't wanna be alone (I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna be alone. yeahhhheeeeee
If there's anything I can say, to help you find your way
Touch your soul, make it whole, the same for you and I.
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe
that you die. but I can feel it in the wind
The beginning or the end
But people keep your head to the skyyyyy
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Folk in your face, you're a superstar
Niggaz hang around cause of who you are
You get a lot of love cause of what you got
Say they happy for you but they really not
Sell a lot of records and you roll a benz
Swoll up in the spot, now you losin friends
All you wanna do is give the world your heart
Record label tried to make you compromise your art
You make a million dollars, make a million mo'
First class broad treat you like a nigga po'
You wanna say "Wait!" but you're scared to ask
as your world starts spinning and it's moving fast
Tryin' to stay sane is the price of fame
Spending your life trying to numb the pain
You shake that load off and sing your song
Liberate the minds, then you go on home.
I must admit, they planted a lot of things
in the brains and the veins of my strain
Makes it hard toain, from the host of cocaine
From them whores, from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
They're from the glock rounds, and lockdowns, and berries
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts
Cause it's a hard row to hoe
if your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong, so some survive
So you're surprised, now I'm bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride, fool I don't wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it
unless you lookin at the canvas of life
and not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid two-fold on technicalities
Clickin your heels, scared to bust how you feel
Pack the steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though
Midwest or Dirty South
Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen
And your cowardly lies never defyin the jackals who babble
Runnin with they pack, tail between your legs
Though the man on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory
Cacklin, helpin the shacklin of your brethern happen
Just by rappin.
LIBERTAD.

N-n-n-not too far but long ago
When life was straight up and cars would move slow
When you were cool if you were pigeon-toed
But things have changed (it ain't so simple)
Now life is a musical
I called Big Boi on the telephone
I said "hey hold up 'fore we put out another song"
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong
Cause ain't nothin changed (it's simple)
Now let's make a musical
Based on big infaction
No words like such grow in some action
And you got us well to a fraction
Cause things have changed (it's all hood)
The Kast go Hollywood

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Verse 1:
Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken,
Words of a chain I don't feel but I see,
visions from me
at twenty three making us free in my community
one day is what I live for,
ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it till I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to cascade
I know its through them plenty figures
cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
up in they rides,
looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter keys, stacking G's
In the South Indies
my nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigger sellin', but can you blame
the fact the only way a brother can survive the game
the block hard to get by the dope dealing, fatal killings
in fair times so writing rhymes
it ain't just the police
we kill each other just lost another brother
fast living will get you took,
thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
off crooked schemes its just a dream
floating face down in the mainstream
Chorus:
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
that's why some are found floating face down in the main stream
Verse 2:
They swan divin'
fit they name be thrashing an album
go-kart rushin' to finish their album then you find them
lost, dog paddling, back stroking, what done happened?
be rhymin' catching the day when the recipe calls for black and
wrong ingredients,
maybe too much herbs and spices,
maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
southern greens and this entice them how them joke the same
so I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job
it just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
but if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
but then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel
the way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
we kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
face down, face down, face down
(Chorus)
Verse 3:
I let you stay in my crib, now you know where I live
when you was hungry, fed you a hot meal, look at the hand you deal
me crudball business giving niggas inches so here, take a foot
luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes,
experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours,
process momma moping like jerry
meanwhile, fairies of the street tinkling pixie dust over greenery
never to obtain another level of con-science
only to test, to poke and see
why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
? with a decision to make, now words shape your destiny
but a missle will take it all the way just as quick as you can say
I wish I never did what I did now face this biz
it was the company you kept, the many places you slept
when you shouldn't have, geekin like a rat, jumping like a trap
contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showin pink for ten
they got you niggas where they want you again,
floating face down in the mainstream
thats why, thats why, thats why
(Chorus)
Verse 4:
Everybody's a player, rubbin them kangols on their head
thinking its all about your clothes, nigger its all about your self
the way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
to dicks oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
you know the history about this clique bitch
oh, what, you want me to call you slut?
then why you fucking all them niggers letting them all up in your guts
but see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
my partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
in the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits
in the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish
(Chorus x4)

Okay okay... well... make up somethin... yeah right

Just begun a game so considered a beginner
Masada for real, this shorty here is here to say
Mahogany go platinum after after that we just parlay
I'm from the Bricks we get kicks, offa loud gun shot licks
Fuck stones and sticks, loudmouths get nicks
This life is plus I be the bill-be-board, Scarface want
italiano, I'm the real McCoy, nigga what?
Can't be a joke I've been through too many games
Niggaz laugh, but my expression wasn't hardly the same
Show me respect cause it's due, you keep the fear
cause I'll get over and believe I'll come back at you

Yo, now

Lump in your throat, feel like a trachea, oh dummy
The pain that's in your chest done made it's way

She nigga bashin sayin you don't need em in your world
Niggaz all dogs? If niggaz all dogs, then what you call broads?
Felines in heat, meowin for some yarn balls
Now you and hear done got to drankin
Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drink
and your girl done got to thinkin
She talkin bout, "Girl you look so beautiful"
You say thank you bein nice you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit
mixed with a chihuahua how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
here's what you do -- you
grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall
Say, "Bitch don't ever disrespect me never not at all"
These simple words can put a pause to half of the applause

Tryin to get you so wet, never been to Spain

The easiest was the meanest, but the skeezer was a beanie

Ready to go at any moment, jumpin' like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so why expect the patience?
Expect the worse but now I'm pacin' back and forth
Inside, I'm melting like water on wicked bitches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clinches
But monkey wrenches was thrown like chairs kings sit on
My prayers seem to long I fall asleep before the endin'
Don't even get to say "Amen"

At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say forget it
Or maybe it's the Devil infiltrating and like Riddick bow

See mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from West Savannah, Georgia, but the SWATS is my home
Never go wrong 'cuz the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, I'm proud of you people's
For sellin' your cracker sacks, I'm glad I'm white not black
Shit, on the real, that's how them mighteys really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned
And now we fallin' apart
You lookin' me in my eye, but you ain't feelin' me in your heart
Yes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour
These niggaz, they leavin' me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower
Now or never, let's stick together and overcome
But they don't feel like marchin', 'cuz they shoes is overrun
Ain't that a bitch?

 <SONGSTART> [Dre]
Me and everything around me, is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumpin like a pogo stick
I never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now I'm pacin
Back and forth, inside, I'm melting like water on wicked bitches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clinches but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long
I fall asleep before the endin, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, so I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick... Bowe
I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
It's just a phase, it's gon all pass, but that gets old too
I'm weakening like a deacon doin dirt
What am I supposed to do?

La, la, la, la, la, woo, woo
You see there will always be someone taller, darker
Maybe wit a little of cheese than I got
But really, shawty you don't need nobody else, no
'Cause baby I am the opening act, the headliner
And the after party, after party, after party, after party, after party
I am all that you'll ever need
I trip on how everybody sees what I am but you, you
I thought you would be brave enough to taste my bitch's brew
Well I thought I was dealing with a man but you're a boy
You're a boy, you're a boy, I can give you everything you want
But I can't be your toy, no, oh no, oh no
'Cause baby I am the opening act, the headliner

Baby I am the opening act, the headliner
And the after party, after party, after party, after party, after party
Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt
Oh, my bad, my bad excuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lolly pop waiting to be licked
We don't play but you think the shit
My bad my bad but that too hot for you lobes
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose
Got nerves like kryptonite Superman couldn't bend those
Kindness kills callous

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Uh, uh, yeah
"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about? Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggaz
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out, or even pull your fuking head
To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like King shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I say Lakewood
You better be strapped cuz them niggaz over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, servin the loyal customers
Rent was due on the 1st of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggaz be wanting drinks and shit from the fuking sto', yo
But that's aight, tho', cuz I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that jive
(Chorus)
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime (2x)
Hey 'Dre, Let 'em know what's up
(Andre)
Time is slippin, slowly but surely
Niggaz I used to hang wit wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots alot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm havin a ball, makin my nickel sacks crawl
To my niggaz got to servin when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
from being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changin us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fly shit, yo niggaz gonna always toke
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggaz don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fuked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slangin it from the South
Talk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fuckin mouth

Too much inspiration
Back when I was a freshman
I learned a valuable lesson
A hoe gonna be a hoe
And it don't matter about you stressin
The only thing you do
Tap that throat and ware protection
And only when she spit it out
Is when you feel rejection
Evidence and DNA drop down
And staining her dress
She is making a great big mess
Would you like to get something off your chest?
And that is no intended pun
I'm just joshing with you Hun
Don't we always have a blast?
As we bust one on one (one on one)
I, I want to get into you
I don't want no girlfriend
Just want to get n2u
I, I want to get into you
I don't want no girlfriend
Just want to get n2u
Now that I'm a graduate
She still got to have it
School days are over
Spike the punch and you can stab it
Jug jug more jug
Push pull more wood
Isotonia club waiting nicely
Cause we go good
Together like slat and pepper
Kool-aid and sugar
Mustard and mayonnaise
Shoulda, coulda and woulda ohhhhhhh
And that is no intended pun
I'm just joshing with you Hun
Don't we always have a blast?
As we bust one on one (one on one)
I, I want to get into you
I don't want no girlfriend
Just want to get n2u
I, I want to get into you
I don't want no girlfriend
Just want to get n2u
Anit talk about commitment
Shit waiting (anit talking bout that)
Anit talking about the wedding rings (yeah no no can't do that)
I hope you aint a gold digging bitch
But Chu a fine little sexy thang

Dopefiends, cryin Jesus, swear they saved

They swear they kingpins but don't have money on they books
I hear so many lies it make me sick
These niggaz called ballers sellin dimes and licks
I can't wait til the day they let me go

As I'm sayin it
I'm like the nba sore thumb on pawn shop tech nine,
Bitch I'm known for jammin
Smoke mary, mary, mary
Put a mean ass flow on top of bad vocabulary
I bust through, intrude, move through distractions
Withstand hits and blows don't lose no traction
I threw a round off flip flop flip flop back at em
If a nigga comin clown then I'm going get the cannon
And the get God back
Knuckle up boy, don't be no fucked boy
Me and guillotine we run some niggas in a big truck boy
Run flat boy, run that boy
Bitch where I'm a send you you can't come back boy
I bring flames to a four alarm fire
I wash him up and ring him out and throw him in the dryer
I hit the door, I'm blowin him like southern band
And they always tryin to find something to say about the brother man
I invent em flip em and send em
Rhymes set you jumped like I poured king cobra over ya
Guess what, this is a stick up
Give me back my shit before I start pickin bricks up
Garbage mc's better run for it
Don't come this way 'cause you can't walk on this side of the yard, (? )
And respect me for takin it to em
So expect me to lay it down and represent my neck of the woods
Yeah, like that, ha ha, yeah yeah yeah
Mystikal and outkast, ha ha
[hook - dre] x 2
If it don't bump off in the club you can't rock

[big boi]
All a the heat rise to the beat wise
To that nigga that spit that street fire
Mystikal, andre and big boi takin em out of the park like mark mcgwire

And you know we doin the big beat oh hell yeah it's gonna be bumpin
Givin you somethin to beat the block with, meet the cops with
My stamina's incredible so sucka don't try to stop this
The d-u-n-g-e-o-n family, merrily
Life is but a dream, I mean a nightmare 'cause it's scarin me

All the way to decatur

Hey, what's your name?
Andre 3000, the year to fear is already here
Must look beyond, sounds from the center of the sun
Reason for a gun, only one
Strong believer in self-preservation
Aahhhhh, oof!
In the state of confused
City of forgotten fate, county of the blues
Street address generation x avenue
But generation y high to the point that I drink
Runnin on a new one
Walkin in my silver boots, need a shoe horn and some church socks
What if I told you that even if you made clocks?
Stops, time rewinds, see what he finds
Then re-arrange and change things that's on your mind
Would you swallow like fine wine or peanut butter?
Would you holler that I'm live and ask another?
Or take no heat and run for cover?

[Big Boi]
We're back
This is MC extraordinaire
Reporting to you for W-A D-F, generation one television
We here in a remote area
Somewhere way back up in the woods
With members of the elite Dungeon Family
Them boys in there workin' on some shit so fire
I bullshit you not
[Killer Mike]
Ey, welcome to Purple Ribbon, prime-time official
Killer Mike, y'all
Killer kill from the ville, go hard on the rhyme
Like a junkie on powder I go hard every line
I'm a ex-Dope Boi but I still rap blow
And I sold more horse than a polo sto'
I'm destined to become a millionaire
Similar to Phil Collins I can feel it in the air
My car change colors like a millionaires
Necklace, get reckless and touch my chain
I put it in the air and bust your brain
Any sucker out there tryna' take my cash
Better pray God with him when I catch his ass
Or he gon' lay there dyin' wit' a bullet in his ass
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bench riders
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Pardon my French but if you give me an inch
I'm a take five kilometres and give it to the commoners
Some dirty white boys and some boochie black girls
Nearly one million sold but I'm still in that world
That's why you won't see Bubba, buck head bouncin'
Unless it's the cream and I'm upstairs countin'
You know the type of bread that don't involve accountants
Continuin' the legacy my forefathers founded
We won a lot of battles but the war is still ragin'
She's turned a lot of tricks but the whore is still agin'
What is rap? What God gave me for my birthday
You ain't D-F dawg, fuck what your shirt say
Talkin' bout he's undeserving of the blessin's
When truthfully the tat was roomin' them suggestions
New ? clean in the game they ?
We ain't them boys that you can't say earned it
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bench riders

[Big Boi]
Every now and then, me and my kin, we get to bussin'
Not in the high school football game, I'm talkin' bout rhyme thrustin'
I'm talkin' bout line crushin', somethin's simply bumpin'
On the low straight out the oven like some blueberry muffins
We got the stuffing like some Stouffers or somethin', macaroni, mackalicious
Mack a bitch or a woman, there is a difference
Not if the woman start bitchin', won't get in the kitchen
Male, chauvinistic, nah, ho, you missed it
I'm just kiddin', just playin', I'm just sayin' we humpin' around
Like the ghost of Bobby Brown and Stankonia lingerin' round
We have found profound sound above ground
When we've split in two parts, no one can block us now
Maybe top lock but we can't stop, let the great white head be severed
We weathered the storm, with feathers, something we treasure
(Well I never) and you never will, suckered up
The Dungeon Family is here to stay and we don't give a flying fuck
We trendsetters off the chain rock wilders, y'all
Sideline uppin' these haters and bench riders

 <SONGSTART> Something's gotta give!
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin? Uhh
Herring homes, unh, martel homes, carver homes, tekwood
Martin luther king, bankhead
Verse One: Big Boi
Under-cover, over da hills and thru tha woods I go
Like green lights, a southern nigga that's comin fo' yo' throat
But not no guillotine see, we be them southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now
You up to par and ready fo yo lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-City high school, was pullin em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and layin em down was just a habit
Just like smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talkin about the click will get you laid down hella swoled up
Hootie hoo slapped ya boyz across the cheek wit Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhymin
Every lyric that he spit be turnin charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls
Girl when you givin up them draws, cause
I got a couple of niggaz down the hall
That wanna hit it too, I'm not the type to be actin selfish
Set it out and let it out and I'll be right back just like Elvis
Cause the postman rings twice...
Hey Mr. Postman...
Chorus: repeat 2X
power, power, I come gimme some
tha deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
let's travel far, tha southern star shines
Verse Two: Dre
Everybody wanna get signed, but (here to tell you)
record companies act like pimps
Gettin paid off what we made when we the ones that's fly like blimps
But ain't no Goodyear, I tell it like it is so I'm like look here
Just willin to get what I deserve my kids to have a mother
and a little house, with a dog in the backyard goin "woof-woof"
Who knows what I'ma say soon's I leave this recording booth
Poof, back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high
There's clouds of clowns, seas of G's
Pro-jects, packed with playas meditating on their knees
Just to make them ends meet, like ground beef, you won't believe
The shit that niggaz attempt cause they got other mouths to feed
besides they own
Chorus
Verse Three: Big Boi
There's some hoes in this house, damn right
I'm thinkin about the way you skull me, guzz me
Suckin me dry like deserts Mojave, Gotti, hotties and honeydips
Likin the way you do me, screw me it make my money flip
Shakin that ass for daddy puttin this gas off in my Cadi-llac
Back, don't ever snap, packin the gats and pimpin whores
Hors d'oevres, swerve, hit the curb because I'm reckless
Back in the days when I was broke I'd snatch your fuckin necklace
You ol' pussy-ass nigga... yeah

 <SONGSTART> Stages in life, no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend
I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony, then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger, couple of kids in minivans
Standin' in the stands like a fan, watch her little man
Run ball...
And every time you see the family, they look happy
Got her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had her cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride, decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the (hide), the spouse in the house
Boy it's cheaper to keep her, you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog, cuss words flow like

Took my shit (Beeitch!) Fuck!

She was fierce on the stove, it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late

 <SONGSTART> Talking: The feeling of being 12 years old and waking up in the middle
of the night and somebody in yo room. Yo heart starts beating so fast
you can hear it pumping. The veins in yo temple pulsate as you stare at
the intruder. Then after a few minutes you realize he ain't moving. So
finally you let 'em hang and turn on the light and the killer turns into
yo coat throwed over the chair.
The feeling of sitting at the red light early in the morning and two or
three motherfuckers cross the street. Yo senses heighten, reflexes
sharpen vision's enhanced adrenaline flows as they rush across the
street you leave the print from the heater grip in yo palm then yo heart
rate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just
goin' to the store.
Many of us mistake Phobia for true fear. Whereas fear is a gift from
God to be used for self-preservation. Phobia are obstacles strategically
placed in society by opposers of positive existence. Through
stereotyping, innuendo, false documentation, and glorification they'll
turn your fear switch to a permanent on. We can change this by changing
the small truth within' the lie. Death is a small price to pay for
respect. Death is a small price to pay for respect. You know who it is.
You know what it is. Peace out.
1: Andre
In these troublin' times
a nigga like me be thinkin' of rhymes
that makes my quarters nickels
plus my pennies and my dimes stack
Don't be lookin' for trouble it be finding me
Try turning the other cheek
I understand but never mind that
Yes Sir guess the light is getting dim
at the end of the tunnel tried to hit me for my rims
I never thought thirty spokes
could attract too much attention
I gotta protect my own therefore
I'm heated just like a kitchen
full of pots and pan Glocks in hand
Shots rung out like ringin' the bells
and then that sucker nigga ran
Damn, I never thought that it
would come to this conclusion
the folks that throwed us
on them boats should be the one's I'm losin'
but naw we don't see it that way
in '94 this is the real no time for play play
betta believe the playas on the loot
need to get they head screwed on tight
when it really get down to the nitty grit
who gone fight pipe down
'cause ain't no better time
to crank it up than right now
we gots to see rump crum down here
and I don't hear nobody disagreein'
Orga-no-i-z-e-Mr. D.J. and me and Big Boi
So don't spend yo whole life
livin' it for the white
You got a 9 to 5 and now
you choose to live it right
You takin' yo ass to the Army
'cause you scared of Revolution
I'm writing everyday to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way that stress is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday
So play your fuckin' job
educated and black I will resort to rob
2: Big Boi
See why in the muthafuck
do niggas be acting up
Do they want me to grab my shit
and lettin' that pistol go ruck
See I be gettin' stuck and stuff
havin' to knock a nigga out about my clout
That's not what it's about
see yes indeed I got that weed
like Daddy Q be havin' them ounces
That nigga the B-I-G be chokin' 'em out
and then I bounces
I got that lyrical flow to make
a hoe pull up her skirt
I drunk that herk & jerk boi
thinkin' of future things to work on
I got my fuck on and
then I took my clothes off
Washed my nuts up in the sink
and then I got more nuts off
Cough it's time to be out
see bein' a pimp is bein' a pimp
I'm dirtier than the shit
on the back of a shrimp
Now ain't that foul
the way a nigga can spit that style
My nigga I spit it I did it
Now suckas need to quit it
'Cause it's real
3: Big Boi
Well it's that nigga that be
wearing Nautica V-necks
and Polo sweats
I got some food up in yo thoughts
and that cess off in yo chest
See livin' up in the dungeon
where we stayed in '93
see that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I
that be me
and when we rock it
Niggas be jocking just like?
you snitch I fucked yo bitch
See and my niggas G'd that hoe
on the South side of Camelton Road
No slippin' in this pimpin'
she was just a horny toad
See I'm a mystery like the
killing of Michael Jordan's father
Was steadily packin' the hoes
when I worked at Foot Locker
I'm gettin' higher than learning
smokin' 'em up and then burning
East Point is on the map
and now my clothes is hurtin'
Now shit done got boring ass
molin' when excess closed down
but niggaz kept sewin' shearin'
stirrin' bein' the pharm assistant that missed
of the folks but some people
tend to joke about this
but it's really dead spirits
You can bet my lyrics
now ya wonder why that we
done stopped and got serious
Wantin' to know where I'm from
and where I need to be
Now that I know comfortable
living give me meat
Can I get back ya wonder why we split back
lure us into pitch black dark
but I sit back and spark
another one to leave ya discombobulated
in that dust livin' in a world
where in nobody do you trust
Then hush never became a major trade
but us in major trouble
'cause we made a too many mistakes
off in the past
Thinkin' you could make it this world
and now we laugh 'cause it's all faults (starts here)
either way ya go ya gotta pay the cost of the mic wind
repeat (last line is changed to:
I'm hangin' with the G-O-O-D-I-E Mob Nigga yeah
Takin' you a li'l higher knowwhatI'msayin' when you learnin' when you

I make no wishes 'cause the modern folk is in the back getting tipsy
off the noggin, how ya settlin' for contact smoke
they havin' a smoke out in my back seat
they passing erb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm making switches
clickin' the switches side to side looking for old snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway my pager broke my vibe
'cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
it's just anothr day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
grab my pistol and my ounce see what these junkies got to give me
'cause it's like that, yeah! forever pimpin', never slippin'

Verse 3: (big boi)
ain't no chimneys in the ghetto
so I won't be hangin' my socks on no tip
how far does it tick fix me a drink I got the remedy
so bring in that ham (not!), don't need no ham hocks
don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies we gots the Mary Jane in the dungeon

the corners in my cadillac my heart does not go pity-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back my elbows out the window, coke, rum and indo
fills my body where's the party, we roll deep we dip to underground
sees a lot of hoes around, I spit my game while waiting countdown

Take notes on how I crept, I's 'bout ta go in depth
This is the way I creep my season here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet
I said subtract so shut up that, nonsense about some solid solid
I gots in crunk if it ain't real ain't right

Forever chill with smith, I sip my fifth, I chill with wess'

You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all "deck, the the

 <SONGSTART>  <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I hope that you are the one
If not, you are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun
And do things I know you like
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
Today, today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
Do sumn' outta the ordinary
Like catch a matinee
Baby, you are the prototype
I think I'm...
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
If we happen to part
Lord knows I don't want that
But hey, we can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track now
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
Let's go, let's go to the movies
(And... action!)
I think I'm in love again...
Girl, right now I wanna say, I wanna say
I wanna say stank you (stank you) very much (very much)
For picking me up
And bringing me back to this world
I can't or not, I can't afford to not record
I think I wanna say
I think I wanna say stank you
Stank you smelly much
For picking me up and bringing me back to this world
Stank you very much...
Hey, hey John
Are we recording our adlibs?
Really, what we were recording just there?
Let me hear that that first one.
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART>  <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> No no no
That's that's part of the
Yeah
I got ya good that time, shawty
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Ain't it funny how you born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception 'cause the sperm did collide
From TNA to DNA, feelings turn to childrens
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence
We livin', breathin', soon we'll be teethin'
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this loogie that I spit
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Little Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months
But Uncle Donnel and ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint, reset
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good does not come without pain
Meaning, before it get better, it's goin' get worse
Like my homies on the sick side still dyin' over turf
That don't belong to urse I mean us, left in the dust
Try to catch up with massah
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers
But Ephesians 6: 12 said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Principalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness
In high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thang, but my name ain't Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle
Yeah, come on, come on
Guess what, guess what
Time to reset this thang
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Listen to me
I awaken to sunlight that's beyond bright
This day will be done right
There is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right
You can handle if tomorrow never come, right
You'll get used to singin' if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Stop playin' go fish, but not below this
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting hmm
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

We stabbin every city when we headed to that bat cave

You focus on the past your ass'll be a has but
Thats one to live by or either that one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure
Andre, got to her station heres my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group aint commin wit it
But im witcha you cause you problay goin through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt, went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin, but examine all the flawsky-wasky
Awfully sad and its costly but thats all shit
BROKE. And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shits creek its week is the last quote
That I want to hear when Im goin down when all's said and done

When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty
I said, "Shawty would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you ballin'?"
I said "Darling, you sound like like like a prostitute", pausing
Oh, so you're one them freaks, get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost
Must take me for a geek a quick way to eat
A neat place sleep, a rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No-go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom

When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty
I said, "Shawty would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you ballin'?"
I said "Darling, you sound like like like a prostitute", pausing
Oh, so you're one them freaks, get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost
Must take me for a geek a quick way to eat
A neat place sleep, a rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No-go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, and i'll support you
I know you like to think your shit don't stank

A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a pain
But she's alive
[Andre 3000 - Verse One]
The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was going down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now
[Andre 3000 - Bridge]
A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a pain
But she's alive
[Woman talking]
I was scufflin' going to school
I was scufflin' working at night
And you know what
I truly believe
And that's why I tell a lot of parents
Single parents, don't tell me what God can't do.
I made sure you had
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything
If a man didn't want to take care of his child
You move on
And that's what I did
I moved on
[Andre 3000 - Bridge]
A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a pain
But she's alive
A boy to raise
At... at a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
[Woman talking]
He always wanted to be a father
But he never took care of you
He ain't have no money
He ain't have nothin'
How can you care about somebody
And you never give the welfare of them
[Andre 3000 - Bridge]
A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a drag
But she's alive
A boy to raise
At a young age...
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone

Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazin'
They don't know, but I do though
Baby my darlin' you make me loose composure
Fragments of a million me
Scattered across the floor to a certain degree
Where, I had to give your mama a call
And thank her for spending time with your daddy
For all its worth, girl what's your frequency
And can I come there frequently?
Slum beautiful, drivin' I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazin'
What I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers
And will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer
Ounce of killa dilla, be makin' my game more flagrant
And once I done had some cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit
Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies
Maybe lady luscious oba kaybee so they say thee
An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like tony Mercedes
And will work every last muscle off in your body like Billy Blanky
Hanky panky, where did you get your gold grill 'cause it's bangin'
And I like then red hot fila straight from Walters off the chain
Fuck them bouige bitches they don't know nothin 'bout you
'Cause you push a big black buick, so fresh, so clean on them trues
Slum beautiful you's the would to me, shawty I dig ya
And I'm lovin' the way them Jordache got a bear hug on your figure
You my nigga, nigga
Slum beautiful, drivin' I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazin'
Look at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you
You're lookin' deliciously divine darlin' you really and truly do
The very thought of has got me runnin' at the speed of love
Explorin' everythin' about you from the ground to the God above
Suddenly I started dreamin', travelin' in time so fast
I could almost taste outer space
I saw the face of God and looked like you and me too
Hello, I'm the man that God made you for
Profound don't you think?, Okay let's put this poetry in motion
I'm shining simply because mother earth I'm your son
Our entire circumference engulfed in emotion
Forever gonna be so fun
Slum beautiful, drivin' I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazin'
I don't know but, it seem like uh
Your daddy must have gave you
A teaspoon of honey every night before you went to bed
Or was it a pack of now laters
'Cause you're the sweetest thing on my head and
I'd like to say that I'd love to make
Love to every molecule of you and if you want to
Spontaneously combust that's what we'll do in unison

Deep the slang is in effect because its Georgia
Kickin they khakis and ... packin yo pieces cause you sposed to cousin

Via atlanta, georgia a li'l spot where
Young men & young women go to experience
They first li'l taste of the nightlife
Me? well i've never been there, well perhaps once
But i was so engulfed in the old "e"
I never made it to the door you speak of hard core
While the dj sweatin' out all the problems
And the troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "set it off," in the right
But it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it
"hey hey look baby they playin' our song"
And the crowd goes wild as if
Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 a.m.
And three niggas just don' got hauled
Off in the ambulance [sliced up]
Two niggas don' start bustin' [wham wham]
And one nigga don' took his shirt off talkin' 'bout
"now who else wanna fuck with hollywood court?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation

When i first met my spottieottiedopalicious angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion
Horse with skates on ya know. smooth like a hot comb
On nappy ass hair
I walked up on her & was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like i chiefed a whole o of that presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes [ya dig]
One moment you frequent the booty clubs &
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations [that is]
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United parcel service & the people at the post office
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that, trapped
Go on and marinate on that for a minute

while the dj sweating out all the problems and troubles of the day
while this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
competing with "set it off" in the right
but it all blends perfectly, let the liquor tell it
"hey, hey look baby, they playin' our song"
and the crowd goes wild as if holyfield has just won the fight
but in actuality it's only about 3 am
and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance (sliced up)
two niggas done start bustin' (wham, wham)
and one nigga done took his shirt off talkin' bout
"now who else wanna fuck with hollywood cold?"
it's just my interpretation of the situation
Hook: damn, damn, damn James
Verse 2: (big boi)
when I first met my spottieottiedopaliscious angel
I can remember that damn thang like yesterday
the way she moved remined me of a brown stallion horse with skates on
smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrap
eyes beaming like four carats apiece just blinding a nigga
felt like i chiefed a whole "O" of that presidential
my heart was beating so damn fast
never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig)
one moment you frequent the booty clubs and the next four years
you and somebody's daughter rising y'all own young'n
now that's a beautiful thang, that's if you're on top of your game
and man enough to handle real life situations (that is)
can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
might not always be sufficient, but the united parcel service
and the people at the post office, didn't call you back because you got
cloudy piss, so now you back in the trap just that, trapped
go and marinate on that for a minute
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I don't want to move too fast, but
Can't resist your sexy ass
Just spread, spread for me
I can't, I can't wait to get you home
Don't want to come on too strong, but
I'll play in you all day long
Just spread, spread for me
I can't, I can't wait to get you home
I, I can't read minds, but I can read yours
I think she says that she wants to pour your
Your, yourself all over me
What you think? I could be wrong, but peoples don't lie
And if they do, by God, they must fry
(Fry?)
You know, like electric chair, the way you stare
(Yeah, I'm there)
You committed a crime and I'm the victim
I've got an eye out for shit that cries out passionately
We'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally
I'm too young to be settling down
Quick to change my mind tomorrow
So now can I borrow your timid torso
More so than your soul, honest me gotta be how I roll
Fuck the rhythm, tuck the rhythm under your bosom
You're the prism, Shirley Chislom
Was the first, let's rehearse making a baby
Put in your order, I want a baby daughter
Dance on the tip of my tongue
Shake the clouds 'til there's no more wetness in them
Tell your homegirls that you will send them
A postcard from 3000, hard!
Don't want to make you feel strange, but
Don't let these words be in vain, so
Spread, spread for me
I can't, I can't wait to get you home
Nature knows that I want you, but
Not unless you want me too, so
Spread, spread for me
I can't, I can't wait to get you home
I don't want to move too fast, but
Can't resist your sexy ass
Just spread, spread for me
I can't, I can't wait to get you home
Don't want to come on too strong, but
I'll play in you all day long
Just spread, spread for me
I can't, I can't wait to get you home
Don't want to make you feel strange, but
Don't let these words be in vain, so
Spread, spread for me
I can't, I can't wait to get you home
Nature knows that I want you, but
Not unless you want me too, so
Spread, spread for me
I can't, I can't wait to get you home
Knowing after

 <SONGSTART> What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us
You make me understand
What it means to be in L O V E once again
Why must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow?
Stank love, stank love
Stank love, stank love
Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop
Till I get ever drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do?
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my God I think I'm 'bout to explode
Stank love, stank love
Stank love, stank love
My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin?
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nerves
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of please we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shock wave
Of an impact so deep but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the remaking
No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of persona, making love after making love
Till ain't nothing but stankonia
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

Everybody's got opinions

Life is made of half illusion (illusion)
Forty percent confusion (confusion)
Whatever's left I'm using to keep myself from losing, yea
You don't know what I've been through (oooh)
Hell I might go through you (ghetto boy that, won't eat, tonight)
Uh-oh, oh no-oahohh (that little boy just wanna eat tonight)
Hey hey (he scuffles with her booty and her face) hey hey
And mm-mmmmmm (mom I'm seekin that sir tea and some soup yea)
All in all it's all in my head
One: Big Boi
You know it's that high guy, from East P.I.
Spittin the realness of reality, you mad at me
boi how you gonna handle me?
You want me to lolligag and talk that bullshit?
I refuse to play so I'm gon' speak that Southern good shit
That harder than yo' hood shit, lil' shit
that make y'all niggaz think about the trigger
before you pull it, on liquor stores and banks
Them folks got more than enough bullets to put that ass
off in the slang, don't claim no gang, we the niggaz
that did that "Ain't No Thang But a Chicken Wang"
But still though, how you gonna play a nigga like dildo
We OutKast til it's over, barbeque and never mildo
For real bro

Conceived under the influence of toxic wasted doctors
Computer buggin debuggin device-a and vice versa

Accept your mind down your spine and out your behind
Fuck you
Three: Andre Benjamin
Synthesizer, microwave me
Give me a drug so I can make seven babies
Pump my breasts up, can you suck the fat up
Please make my life appear

Just take your pick, a yellow red
A black or a blue one
Virtual reality, virtual, BULLSHIT
Synthesizer preachers can reach you
up in the pulpit
Who a bitch?
Give me my gat so I can smoke this nigga
Tell his mamma not to cry
because they can clone him quicker
than it took his daddy to make him
Niggaz bitin verbatim
Thought provokin records radio never played dem
Instant, quick grits, new, improved
Hurry hurry, rush rush, world on the move
Marijuana illegal but ciggarettes cool

Who knows... where this flower... grows
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Hold up
Oooh, oooh, somebody done told you you wrong
[Verse 1]
OK, I started out all alone
Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginnin to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm livin it through this song
A movin vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset!
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escapin me
In the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died
Therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win
[Hook]
Throw your neck out, throw your back out [4x]
[Verse 2]
Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a parrty? Not hardly, I'm tryin to stay up outta that womb
Or that p-u-s-s uss! I said uss
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit! Smash and turned it timid
Hell everyone was sufferin, the house was feelin wicked
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swolle
For the most part you fuss, fight, fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leadin a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign
[Hook]
Throw your neck out, throw your back out [4x]
[Verse 3]
K-O, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas
Now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetins
And then my son he can't talk, when I change him he's peein
I think he's pissed
I can't dismiss the matter of the fact because he saw you and me argue
Now the energy is comin back
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax
Tapes, CDs
Baby please, you make me wanna scream
You're on my team startin first string so why are we arguin?
Tapes, CDs
Baby please, you make me wanna scream
You're on my team startin first string so why are we arguin?

Baby please, you make me wanna scream
You're on my team startin first string so why are we arguin?

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> All aboard!
Or, are all y'all bored?
It's good to have y'all back now
Ladies and gents
Y'all already know what it is
God don't make no mistakes
God don't make no mistakes
Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
Twenty always been the five (?) so spittin' I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, made me kind of ...
'Cause when I saw her, I sweat and made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow, but of joy, so listen here, y'all
I grab the mic and move the crowd and disappear
Dog, back in '94, that was the motherfucking year home-boy
Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum, stacks on deck
Claims (?) tellin' us to pay our taxes
Walkin' round the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen mine, now (?) to the masses
It's been a good long road
Now it's time for me to go
I say, Goodbye
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can't even fly
(I fly, I fly, I fly so high)
Welcome to my life, I think it's time we take it back
I gotta give you all the facts so you see what type of cat
That you dealing with, now in ATLiens she was killin' it
And then my Auntie passed, she was like my mother, I was illin' it
The first person close to me to die needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy, angry daddy, Uncle ... was steady chilin'
So you gotta keep on livin' like ... the beginin'
It's your birthday
Even on your worst day
Be like the first day
I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know about ... got hurt
I-I-I be on that Kryptonite
That means I can't be hurt
Gotta leave this place
It's been cool
But I gotta go
It's been a good long road
Now it's time for me to go
I say, Goodbye
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can't even fly
(I fly, I fly, I fly so high)
Livin' on a train
Shoulda asked you for remains (?)
I'll be back again
I know we've been through a lot, and I ain't perfect, but I swear to you, I'm a changed man.
Livin' on a train
Shoulda asked you for remains (?)
I'll be back again
And now it's time to say goodbye
They should've turned me loose
I was all about my team
But now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person
But I'm deadly ... too
You can achieve anything
That you put your heart in to
See, the second hand won't ever stop
And neither will the clock
Nigga Big still hit the stage
By himself and still rock
'Cause when your faith is in the right place
See, He ain't gon' let you flock
You can say whatever you want
I bet you can't do it like 'Boi Stop'
Before you say you ...
Please no excuse this time
Don't be afraid to fly, fly, fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye
Time to pack up and ride, ride, ride
Gotta leave this place
It's been cool
But I gotta go
I can take it from here, ladies. Y'all done a good deed tonight.
It's been a good long road
Now it's time for me to go
I say, Goodbye
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can't even fly
(I fly, I fly, I fly so high)

Now, if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use
Abbreviation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See, ain't nuttin' changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin'
Hair with stylin' gel in it, throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat or finds your lost remote
And this for dem niggaz workin' at the airport
Who got laid off, I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole, whole, world, world

Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look, how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat runnin' like Randy Moss
Ride dat bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gatherin' no moss
Mami, I'm comin', I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac, Outkast just won't stop

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom, medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismal
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate, now, even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's persuable
Doing God's willing, all things that are doable

Is a short period of time, a mere fourteen years
On this precious mother earth
You see Tisha had issues
An' her decision making skills were still in it's early stages
Know what I am talking about
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause
Just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, Shouldn't I? I can't, I have to
Mama will never see me the same
Daddy and big mama, I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat
In the rear of the house
The unthinkable
Moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
No way of expressing her feeling to her mama
Or anybody else in her life
Tisha now came to the crossroads
An' now she got to choose
Fatality
Fatality
Fatality
Fatality
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Yo
Just so you all know what time it is
It's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T
I ain't even goin say the motherfucking rest
You know
We talk about it all day long baby
We fin'a break you off with some brand new shit
This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and had a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
She'll be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool
You see, I cock back glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots by givin hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To all my real niggaz, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we makin noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's goin drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock
They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Scrotum, Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle
Mr. Cockerspanielle in Your Poodle, after school tutor
Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Come to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Push a glock for me now, sale cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now out wit me now
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool
I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed and bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the street fame
I just tell it how I see it nigga, fact is fact
The first I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props
Konkrete and Big Boi beatin through your Speakerboxxx
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool
Ludacris, yeah I keep a glock in case you like to leak alot
Meanwhile, crank the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx
Get the fuck on the ground
Is just a phase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe I will stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you wanna romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through neighborhood stop signs
It's my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
A hundred though, bitch, diamonds shimmerin
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for the strap below
I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool
Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle up the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed
Now we got seven more points on the board, fa sho
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think he's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player, pimp, ganster, poet
We goin spit it, we goin show it to your ass
"You're a champion" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre"
I say "people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay"
OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division
We did split it down the middle so you can see both divisions
Been spittin damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be quittin
Fuck, nigga
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> All aboard
Or all y'all bored?
It's good o have y'all back now
Ladies and gents
Yall already know what it is
God don't make no mistakes
God don't mke no mistakes
[Verse 1]
Little do they know when I was brought up into this game
Point ain't always in a vibe for spitting I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kind of, sorta
'Cause when I saw her I sweat and made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared dog
Back in '94 that was the motherfucking year homeboy
Then that southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen we was practicing
Reciting rhymes to sharpern minds now lets deliver to the masses
[Chorus]
It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
And high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high
[Verse 2]
Welcome to my life I think its time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts s you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with now on ATLiens we was killing it
And then my auntie pass she was like my mother I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and grandaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's yo birthday even on your worst day
Live it like the first day I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I, I be on that kryptonite that means I can't be hurt
Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I got to go
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Even on the train
Should've ask two per men
I'll be back again
(Know we been though alot I ain't perfect but I swear
to you I'm a changed man)
Even on the train
Should've asked two per men
I'll be back again
(From the caboose)
[Verse 3]
Now it's time to say goodbye they should've turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
And you can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
When your faith is in the right place see he ain't gon let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy stop!!
[Bridge]
Before you can say you can't at all
There's no excuse this time don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go
[Chorus]

 <SONGSTART> Greetings, earthlings
From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers
Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South Post slums
Its Just Two Dope Boyz In A Cadillac This ol' sucka MC stepped up to me
Challenged Andre to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called freestyling
Whole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding
I say look boi, I ain't for that fuck shit; so fuck this
Let me explain "only child" style so you don't dis'
I grew up to myself not round no park bench
Just a nigga busting flows off in apartments
It goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods, Coupes to the Villes
Hitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the playa chill
In this atmosphere this ain't no practice here
We cutting the fool now
I'm doing ya at the house and throwing you out because I'm through now
Don't you love the way we claiming Bankhead, stankhead
Looking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop
Yeah tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes they get evicted
I'm dealing wit Queens in my castle ain't worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the pro-jects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond at the exit with a sign saying "We'll rap for food"
My face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the windex
Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong jus like a syntax
Error, bring the terror to your dome like P.E
Prone to finish this out cause this be a free-style
Now who them boyz that be having the crunk every occasion
This side niggas dustin, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm
We just drop...

Must keep self out of harm out of danger's way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail
Bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell! you thought you was happy
Until that court date came couldn't abort that case
Nobody to take your place family home is at stake
Too late to escape and get on the run!

Once upon a rhyme one time when I was a child
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop they worked for every penny!
Didn't have many but had enough to get by! enough to get fly!
Only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went
Like mom and dad's relationship, take a trip
You got the potato chips? I'll bring the hot sauce!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done

1979 dirty south, local lounge
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit!
Graphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams!
No members to remember but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said
We executed the game plan 'cause we got that hot sauce!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done

No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And southern pride I be, checkin' my fuckin' head
Scared, lookin' up in your face, Boy I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be
Enemies in the P's freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo, flow zone like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could yo' hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin'
Never bakin', rebukin' satan, we had you waitin'
For the second coming funny how time flies when you're rhymin'
La-Fa-Ce records, I think they got that perfect timin'
To be doper than Saddam believe the Nation of Islam
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffin' that dope up out your car
I think they overstep they boundaries
OJ, not guilty, that's how they found he
I felt the pressure like sun shinin', while raining at the same time
I kept on rhymin', not complainin'
Storm bringing cats and dogs my catalog be the size of golf balls
Throw up your daisy dukes, I'm hazardous to all you boss hoggs
And Roscoe P. Col' people, who could boost my locomotive
But enough of that everyone can rap unless they ain't supposed to
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I
Compose won't y'all get sick of that
'Cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip hop, you find that shit in the gift shop
But to each his own, my speech is gon'
Keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy then I'm happy
Even if you just hate my fuckin' guts go 'head and damp me

Come dumb, come young, come blind
Unwind, confined to the situation we facin', 'cause it's time
Tic, Tic Boom!

Tic, Boom, Tic, Tic, Boom! (4x)

When will we all awake up out of this dream
Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers
The human beings, man acting as if he was the Supreme Being
Clocking the souls of men out like he was G.O.D. and W.A.R.
There will be no tomorrow, but sorrow and horror will follow
The hollow hearts battle for dollars
Politicians, modern day magicians, physicians of death
More health care for poor health who makin' us ill?
They making us kill, it's makin' me spill my guts
Chill, big lay in the cut, for what I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nothing all day but sit around and watch the Cartoon Channel
I'll rap about the presidential election and the scandal that followed
And we all watched the nation as it swallowed and chalked it up
Basically, America, you got f***ed -- the media shucked and jived, now we stuck!
(Verse 3):
Operation Anaconda: ask yourself, was it full of bleeps and blunders?
Did they ever find Osama? And why in the f*** did Daniel Pearl have to pay
The price for his life and his wife plead twice?
See Al-amin got life and Fred got dead Hampton
To dampen the dream of the Panthers they got the answer
For ransom, as we breathe together, as we dream together
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better but it got to
He gave me this microphone so I must rock your brain waves
Airwaves energize and shock you -- y'all got me?
Well I got y'all long as I know you listening

 <SONGSTART> [Big Boi]
February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
and she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home, down in the West Side projects
Changin over foodstamps, and hittin a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts, lickin leaves, rollin reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggaz around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin cable off in every room
So follow the beans, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you comin with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the West Side ain't takin no shorts on the dime
So fire it up
Chorus:
Now now now nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, oune in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)
See, niggaz in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doin it for years, so these niggaz ain't gone change
They comin around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearin furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
as long as there's that "tic tic" followed by that bump
I'm down to stick a hoe if she got a G-strang
Cause the niggaz in the Pointe ain't changed, main
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another
Chorus w/ variations (repeat to end)
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Intro: Big Boi
Uhh
As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
We finna enhance your brain, check it out
Verse One: Big Boi, Andre
Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Pointe didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walkin to the sto'
Caught a nigga slippin, but now I lay it to the flo'
just like carbon, cuz I got the heat in my rhythm
Momma nay not, never braggin just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cuz we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine
activity, my soliloquoy, may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call
Chorus: Andre
Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...
Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...
Verse Two: Big Boi, Andre
It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies
Yo, we take no shit, like ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'
But not for long cuz we got a better sack to serve
Tryin to take you other people for your rims at the curb
Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go head, go head
More head for me, while you ride to the beat
Drop, like Tears, like For Fears, you know
Shout Shout let it all out, just for my peers
And pupils who feel like it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine
Chorus
Verse Three: Andre
Okay, like this, yeah yeah
One time for my boy doing King shit
Two times for Legit and it don't quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times OutKast and it don't stop
One time for my cuz doing Queen thangs
Dead fresh to the teeth eatin chicken wings
Three times for my guhls in the beauty shop
Four times OutKast and it don't stop
*long interlude, Chorus again (fades)*

 <SONGSTART> Hey...
Uh huh...
Well all right...
How y'all doin? Yes ma'am... lookin' mighty fine...

I've been around the world,
Seen so many pretty girls,
But i still get overwhelmed, when I look in your eyes...
Been from Maine to Spaine,
But everything seems the same,
But I only feel a change, when I look in your eyes...
I know you're upper class,
I know you got pussaz,
Every man wanna kiss your... (gasp)
and I do, too,
Sometimes I'm just a clown,
And everybody puts me down,
I guess I'll come around, when I look in your eyes...
Tell me what's a man to do?
To get close to you?
I'm just a lonely fool, when I look in your eyes...
Don't tell me no this time,
If you do, it will blow my mind,
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
Its an awful thang...
I guess its time to say good-bye,
But I gotta give it one more try,
I'm only satisfied, when I look in your eyes...
Oh, Please come home with me,
Oh, Don't you wanna marry me?
I'm even gonna rub your feet, when they stink... (I don't care!)
How can I let you down?
I'm always gonna be around,
I'm simply astound-ed, when I look in your eyes...
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> (andre 3000) the moring after
(girl) what time is it, 7: 48
where where where are my panties?
oh my god where are my panties
Damn what i don't, he gon think im a hoe
fuck that i liked it
I was drunk and it was my birthday anyway
maybe I should just lay here and let him touch my booty
but he don't even know my name.
(andre 3000)i know she think i think she just some kinda hoe
I don't give a shit about giving it up on the first night
that just let me know, she know what she want outta life.
What a hell of a god damn way to wake up
ooh that shit was good
Maybe she'll get me some breakfast
She so goddamn sweet, sweet as she wanna be
ooh i just wanna lay in her hair
You can't fall for her, don't fall for it you can't fall for it ice cold
(voice)ice cold
(andre 3000)maybe i'll just roll over and lay on her booty
yeah naw naw naw now just lay here and be cool ice cold
(voice)ice cold
(andre 3000)what what what if she's the one
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Hello Lord, it's me again
I just wanna make to love the whole globe
And all her girlfriends now don't that make ya mind move
Like smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit a bomb
Numb be it view, or Saudi Shawty
I figure before the first gun blast, they know who gone win
Now won't that make us all fools
Like class clowns praying Private Ryan comes round
Sound travels at one thousand, one thirty, feet per second
Niggaz in the street they want it hurry
When niggaz start biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Answer quick do you know what desire is? Huh?
Apparently not that's why you get what you got
Now answer this do you know what fire is? Yeah
The body of hot, the motivator of pots
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms
Thank I'm finna vom? Ya move like ya mean it she'll cum
Prom night might excite a down right fight like
White blood cells to the common cold rebel
Night gets jealous of day play is no longer
The feelin' gets stronger than Ammonia sticks inhale
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs finna blow right up in your face
Look at the way you look at me I see it on your face
All your hate emanates but you still hesitate
'Cause you want inside of my head but don't know how
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown
Fuck that I see the way you were
See the way you smirk I'm catching you where you work
God only knows all the trouble that grows
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
Can I blast those who point the finger at me
Who criticize and talk shit so freely
Fuck double XL, you're a size too small
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill
I'm the outcast comin' to blaze the grass
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass
Dre, pass me the glass of wine
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling
Jump into my ragtop and get all in
I'm the bomb, planted in your car, why you frozen?
Pop the tape in ignite the xplosion
The world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours
The world is lost, the world is tossed
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs finna blow right up in your face
With a one-two punch, B-Real and Andre dropped they verses
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams oh, yes it's curtains
No bullets burpin' oh just lyrically twerking
Making a statement, when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
Is kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
Jumpin' the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer, got the public's ears
Fucked up can't hear, Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at?
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang lit like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac
Six woofers and four amps, lo pro vogues on swole
With the carriage lamps diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
Come in peace but then xplode like booty traps
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs finna blow right up in your face
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Piece by piece, this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys, let the lies go
If you wanna be a hoe, go 'head and don't be scared
Many a bitch, represents, and is led
Whichever way no I'm not gay
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs, to feed, takin what we need
To succeed, you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared
If you scared, say you scared
Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a FUCK what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out
If you scared, say you scared
Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
Niggaz on that Gil Scott dope (hint hint)
At age fifteen they start smokin Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trapped
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Wasduced to hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it
If you scared, say you scared
February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all though bruh?
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggaz you touch me
I blow up the micraphone like Marilyn Manson, you can't hush me
Yeah
Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine, I go off like mines
Blowin suckers to smithereens, we was never folks
If we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fuckin men
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin up shop, we already established
You lap doggin, we boss hoggin
Grown men, don't beg for attention
Keep wishin, high heels clickin
Paper champions, leavin with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
On the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
In da head, missin ounces, zip code, eight miles
Suckas, think I got they package
But they still eatin moo-moo, oink-oink
And fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl
The truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it
So remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo.B
Still standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin
Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
We get this shit together our power's enormous
You can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth
You scared, you scared, say you scared
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Navem nu, cuando sol
Tutu nu, vondo nos nu
Vita em, no continous non
Nos nu ekta nos sepe ta, amen
You can be sure
Some will owe to get high
you may hurt till you cry
You may die... (you may die)
Keep on trying (keep on trying)
Till it's summer, in the city
Till it's summer, in the city
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> So how would I look
Laid out on the table, huh?
C'mon tell me
I don't know
Well, you wouldn't take much
Yeah?
You're beautiful
You really think so?
About the most beautiful thing
I've seen in Idlewild
But then you're not from Idlewild!
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Shh! (Laughs)
(Church girls)
You trying to leave here without us?
(Rooster)
Come on this way, both of ya'll, come on this way... come on this way
Let me get a sample first
(Gunshots)
(Zora)
Keep your ass away from my husband
