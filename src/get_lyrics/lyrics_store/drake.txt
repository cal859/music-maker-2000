 <SONGSTART> Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap to pay the bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors pay my bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billi's, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOAT's for it
Ugh, I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready, fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal
Could it be the way that I'll catch up(Ã9)

All my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds
Treating diamonds of Atlanta like it's king of diamonds
Take a flick I look like Meechie look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man I told my city I'd be gone till November, then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God put both hands together that's amazing grace
6 God selfish with the love, I need all the praise

Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper

 <SONGSTART> Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were
to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4, 000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes
from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champÃº, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off with Ain't I
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know

 <SONGSTART> Yeah
All you self promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fucking game thank us
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris bottle sender
Check picker upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle
Too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy
They tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me
Ha-ha-ha-ha
No way out cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road and I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac
Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down, especially not right now
Certain shit just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that no love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that, damn nigga, what is that
Y'all don't hear no songs then hit my phone like you did that
And you even hit my line like where you been at
It's always on some shit like when can I get a favor
Or where my bitch at, like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, White and Red on my body cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just RosÃ© and calamari
Look now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose cause in every situation
I'm the bigger artist, always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb shoulder just to hit the Kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la la?"
Chubbs, why try, I'm a thug, I'mma die high
Got the Rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime Drizzy over there, tryna make you
Make you dance to this, yeah I make you dance to this
I rode big body, widebody, Calabasas road winder
Sunshinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys I blow Keysh right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep but I'm awake
For that one night you niggas try to reach inside my safe
Don't push me cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greasy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line, I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find
You SWV cause you weak and I'm always always on your mind
Yeah
And we can't stop
Make you dance to this
I'mma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha-ha
Bod breed bod bwoi
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Yeah
This song's from old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know
For my niggas, though
You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just being Frank with you
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with you
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters and saddle luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Straight white pre?, why's it always me
Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real
Some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press over the summer for allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga who's time is comin'
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still know for the music
I swear, fuck them niggas this year
I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay in the shit, there's a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like quarters off multi-platinum recordings
Eat it like I'm seated at Swiss so to's and to so's
Nothin' was the same, this shit for Easy and Cocoa
This shit for Kareem, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill
We do this shit for real
All them boys in my will
All them boys is my wheel
Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to poppy, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryin' to win here again
A young nigga tryin' to win here again
Man, what's up
Yeah
A young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty
Aww yeah
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Rrrr Ting
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy
Get hurt, boy
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand the concept of puttin' money first, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy (worst)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl
And she my girl
And nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy (hot up in the 6)
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy (hot up in the 6)
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed, boy (hey)
Black Benz on the road, boy (on road)
Already had a Rolls Royce (on road)
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy
I give a fuck about his squad, boy
I give a fuck about your mob, boy
I'm the real 6 God, boy
I'm about to say a true thing
I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
God damn, you changed
I put it on 'erything
It's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new
I'm not new
Yeah
I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah
All I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah
My sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm...
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, just save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
Like told yah, I thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Meyers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young but I'm makin' mills use to work the night shift
Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' mills use to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing
I'm owed, you gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, this not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young but I'm makin' mills use to work the night shift
Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' mills use to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift
If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, oh you gotta love it
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside
Oh you tried, it's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual
So I guess it's understandable man
Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my message like we have words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach to you so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my peace about it
Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yea, boy you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll
Best I Ever Had seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take at ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses
Putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
Oh you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Too rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight we like to, we like to, we like to-
Yeah, if shit was at a eight we like to make it ten
1da sent this in, I'm goin' up all the way
I don't like to talk when there's nothin' else left to say
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play, your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey-
I gotta breathe in real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only bless when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate, man
I had to cop a feel like presto, voilÃ , tada
Never a matter of "Could I?" or "Should I?"
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side, I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold on, but I-
Miss makin' 'em pay
Helipad from Will Smith crib straight to the stage
Three Forum shows, but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, y'all stay safe in this place
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin' play, your nanny is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey-
Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I can't fly if I can't sit on the wing of that shit
Try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I'm payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys
Yeah, never a matter of "Could I?" or "Should I?"
Kiss my mom on the forehead, then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side, I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold on, but I- (haha)
Hahaha, I can't argue with you
No! You mad!
Look at you! You mad!
You big mad! (hahaha)
I'm happy!
Leave me alone!
I just want some money
A lot of money
I don't get paid to argue with you
No! Who is you?
You ain't nobody
You mad!

Coastline [?]
Plots that don't twist
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city
This shit ain't gonna stop
It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better
Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than 'em telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'mma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose a bet, we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jangalang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)

 <SONGSTART> These are my 1 St. Thomas flows, me, my niggas, and some Madonna ho's
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go, yeah
Discussin' life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds flow
Fine dining, pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'
These other rappers gettin' that inferior feelin'
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healin'
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'
If you ain't got it you ain't got it, the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is goin', I heard it pays
I just came off makin' two million in thirty days
Damn, I guess it does is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because
But Weezy I'm just out here reppin' us
'Til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit
I asked kindly if no one out here would bring their feet up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it, I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city tryin' to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the shit
I swear, ah, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced yo' ass to let up
Why yo' scary ass lookin' down? Pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous get-up
With nose plugs in now, I can smell a setup
So you're just wastin' your time, you only makin' me better
Yeah, I try to tell 'em don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chasin' cash, that's my brother from the surf club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch
Now we just fuckin' all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considerin' the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
'Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for you all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it 'cause they about to let the realest team in
Throwin' up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwin' touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we started to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Man is this what y'all want?
In my best Chris Tucker impression
Duckin' your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars, all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to comin' in second, but I never sneeze, Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah, that's what y'all want?
October's Very Own, Young Money, ATF
Thank Me Later in this bitch, what's up?
Free Weezy in this bitch, what's up?
June 15th in this bitch what's up?
Noel, that's it
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Diamoexplainnds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year it's all business
It is a shame that a couple of 'em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, it's just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippin'
I know I got a couple things that lil' wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Don't let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I can't let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it's lit up
Jim moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple warhol's for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like I'm driving into something
Bitches on the kid like I'm iverson of something
Like a sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, it's Drizzy baby
I'm ready
Alright, J Prince I got em
Look, I'm really the heir
To the fortune of a millionaire
Talking money with me's really unfair
At the border like I swear
I have nothing to declare
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year
Even if you never met me
You can tell I'm on that same shit
Loyal as a motherfucker
Nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me
Cuz I often speak they language
So well spoken
Man I should've went to Cambridge
Y.O.U.N.G hoe
Women they can be so
Motivated by money
That's why they be on me foe
Ask your favorite rapper homie
Guarantee that he know
If he is the one
I'm the zero.
Damn
Please comprehend
I am a surf club general
I'm mister consistent
I have never come in intervals
You don't wanna be caught in the middle
Like a centerfold
I'm committing suicide
If we're ever identical
Click-Clack-Pow
How you like a nigga now
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me
Imma be home in a minute
That's my city
And I run it
You just run around in it
They see me out in person
And say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my playground
Don't fuck with my swinggg-set!
We get to pitching
And that's when it gets to piling
I'm calling your bluff
Don't act like you can't see me dialing
I'm in
Low-Cut Louies
With them hard denim jeans
And a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket
Holla at me!
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone
I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there
Come right in
Set your bag down

Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fitting for what I'm about to do
No you ain't explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll be fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do wit it

oh oh oh oh oh

Now I finally got you right here.
So baby imma lock my door and disconnect my phone
Cuz I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top
So let your hair down
I took the night off for you.
Girl I'm gonna
Turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fitting for what we're about to do
Come right in
Set your bag down

 <SONGSTART> Haha, haha
Yeah, ayy
(After dark)
In a whip so low, no one's gotta know
Knocking at your door, I don't gotta work anymore
You can put your phone out here girl, you need two hands
You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after dark
Late night, like left eye
I'm creepin',
assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is driving me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're ducking calls or missing calls 'cause
You've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changing
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (after dark)
In a whip so low, no one's gotta know (no one's gotta know)
Knocking at your door,
I don't gotta work anymore (I don't gotta work no more)
You can put your phone out here girl, you need two hands (ooh, yeah)
You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after dark
Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right,
get your mind right, it's gon' be a long night (ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the shorty, after dark
And when it's time to duck it, we can go
In a whip so low, no one's gotta know (no one's gotta know)
Knocking at your door,
I don't gotta work anymore (I don't gotta work no more)
You can put your phone out here girl, you need two hands (ooh, yeah)
You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after dark
93.7, WBLK It's after 9 on the Quiet Storm

 <SONGSTART> Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off of denim, fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (True)
Got everything I got everything
I can not complain I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up thats all me
Stay true thats all me
No help that's that's all me, all me for real
Came up thats all me
Stay true thats all me
No help that's that's all me, all me for real
I touched down at '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked girls that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next
But I'm about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat
I'mma make it last forever
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I'm on the road box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
I just got paid like eight advances
God damn!
Got everything, i got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I dont even know how much I really made i forgot its a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up that's all me
Stay True that's all me
No help that's all me, all me for real
Came up that's all me
Stay True that's all me
Ho, shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the 'rents do
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything, Everything but gentle
But I still take my time (time), man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

 <SONGSTART>  <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> e.,,,
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up; she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give or take" world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh
No lights but them infrared lights
Long life, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Ready, set, go
Go, go, go, go
Go til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch!" Quote/unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied?
But every rapper named "Sean" got money?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's
Oh my Allah, Lordy lordy lordy, I took your chick
Now you want beef and I am chuckling like I'm Porky
Cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard, because bitch I'm an emergency
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
So good, so good, Westside, so hood
I do it.
Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding
Weezy with me, I just stepped out of the strip club
Made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I don't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your own girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with ME when she tells you she needs some "me time"
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the locks in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one
So call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that
All in the Sprite, all in the Sprite
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm a bout to talk a blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women are you here?
Are you here right now? Huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look your getting all your friends, and your getting in your car
And you're coming to the house, are we clear right now, huh
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things, niggas see me rolling and their mood change
Like a muthafucka'
New floors, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some steps, let' just fuck each other
Talking filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it
Ooh, it's the 8th wonder
Wonder how I keep coming with the bank number
Downplay the money
I play it off cause you ain't had a lot
She gon' say I'm cocky, told her you know I get that a lot
Coke game, like a night game
At the rave, cocaine, came with the scale mane
Tryna be the only one, that's a lone race
I call you Billy Jean, but what would Mike say
In LA, in LA, we at the mansion, all day
In MIA, all the girls with it
Yeah, late night they say don't stop, get it, get it
8 mil' for the new home
See the gold car, she like why home
No shades, I bring it to your face nigga
Yeah, like what you say, what you say nigga
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I swear to you, Lord
Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL6 with half a B
They know that money begets money, so naturally
Me and Half could blow a couple stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two partners in that Caprice
With no copies made, I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mold you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream but dog, me and success are two things
You don't wanna find yo ass between
Back against the wall like plasma screens
The inside of my wallet is pasture green
And you are now hanging with the Asthma Team
Sweetie, catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and every night is New Years
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executive calls
And with me, women be building these skeptical walls
But once you slept with one dime, man, you slept with them all.
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression,
It's forever blue
Cheer up baby, You don't see all this revenue
I started the game at level two, I'm saying
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market,
I parallel the fly and spur Tony Park it,
And it's cool if you spill something it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior color only dark shit
Toronto's where you living today,
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play.
I would advise you to really make a move
Sooner than later.
Cause these are only the joints
That I'm giving away
You feel me?
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what's up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
23 and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> im good i don't need no help
cuz im better off by myself
then to start over with somebody else
and baby its easy for you to go and give your heart to someone new but im goodeith just dwelling home memories
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> [Drake]
She be jumpin up and down tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partyin and fashion
Dont know where shes going I do not plan on asking, At all.
Cus her spirit is free
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
If her basement is locked, then i swear she would agree
Im the only one she loves
Theres no copies of the key, Homie Thats A Guarantee.
[Drake - Verse 2] (*New*)
Dont forget your Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when the cameras are flashin
Other dudes would suffocate her I dont want to gas in
Dont know where shes going and I do not plan on asking
At all, Ive never been the type, felt alike
My connection with n-ggas that wanna fight over women, thats not right
Theres too many in the World
Homie you can have your pick
But I swear that ones my girl
I swear that ones my girl

Oh man
Oh man, oh man

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoaâvery important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
[Chorus]
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

I'm black and Jewish
Don't be so foolish
I'm black and Jewish
It's a Mitzvah
[Verse]
Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer
[Interlude]
Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael
Ve'et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy
Do not go to Feingold's, though
The pickles are rubber
And I will not be harming ya
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada
Daddy from Africa
Best of worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya
Challah!
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> It's what you all been waiting for ain't it
You weakly entertainin
For me to get a hold of this beat
Go ahead claim it
I'mma bout to paint a picture
You niggahs go ahead frame it
Since we gettin sinfeld
With that jerry and elaine shit...
I flow far from medeocer
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck a 54
So it's obvious ya'll be steady rollin with some jokers
And me? I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn. can you niggahs get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the ebarresement, don't even aproch her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
(ughh) and I was praying I would drop june,
But label reps applying preasure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for pet sakes
You fake gangsta rappers a clecha
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet drake
I'll be in your face,
Like "no speak a la engliash"
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for ya'll material motives
Cause if you like it ya'll shud stick with me
My money good, I ain't neva had to flip a key
Alotta ice, alotta cream like dickey d
Might cut the phone and disapear like mishy me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a harry bendale like it's slippery
And your ex mans a hatter oficialy
Probably cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah... that's the reason why he looking hard
Cause I've done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar
He just made cause his gurls at the house
With her tounge stickign out,
Like a Michael Jordan rookie hard
Let me addrres this, parden me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could of been gotti in the flix
But at this point I'm just pocking a body with a stick
Now a days rapping is a childrens hobby
And grils keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I gotta buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I try'd to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pump me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionare shades, fade with the waves
I smurk at a niggah if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every niggah except trey...
(eyy) I'm outta here baby, they asked me about the past years and how does it phaze me
I wudnt take it back, naww not if they pay me
Unless you betcha that's expencive cause it's not a?
Spittin a crock pot of bottemless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggahs some hope
You put the yay beat and put that shit in a joke
Well... I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Niggah keep your two cents I ain't trynna leave you broke
Life of a don, lights keep gloown
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
Something crazy on my arm...
And heres another hit barry bonds
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> [singing:]
You can't love, but I bet ya
Yo can't hine yeah
[Verse 1:]
Here we Gooo
The 1st time aroud
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhymein Now
I'm seeing it clearer
The season is nearer
And still I must change
I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most
But I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work
But their all hopein' He'll
Emerge the victim
My words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that u heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin before ya'll
I barely get tired
I'm rarely inspired
And you accompish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' qoutas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova,
Be in the thrown instead of being ya own
But look
[Chorus:]
Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout the safeway to the verse here we go
[Verse 2:]
It's like I'm makin moves in my city tho
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin to get with tho
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at 1st but really they two faced
Hopein u trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you lables can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh
[Verse 3:]
Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a friday
Streaks by me like I took a picture in a drive way
I roll down strips and holes down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin I am dropin a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We hanin fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up
Holla!

 <SONGSTART> [Intro]
Yeah
Link Up TV, Behind Barz
Big up man like Rasheed, Joey, Tadas
Shoutout Giggs for settin' the ting
SN1, OVO
Mm-hmm, yeah, look
[Hook 1]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
[Verse 1]
Stay in big six six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm getting up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm taking the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seeing a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're taking control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turning these yutes into dust
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Big Scorpion, out now, yeah, look
[Hook 2]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
A good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
[Verse 2]
Think you know me, that's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slew
Throwin' up six like man have flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried about sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck about jeans or crep
Or going to Milan or going to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that, let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, done that clash
Got no sense like jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots and cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like going tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that
[Outro]
Yeah, Link Up TV
Drizzy Drake
Maddas, jheeze

 <SONGSTART> I'm so fucking dumb I wrote "diamonds" on my thumbs,
It's a diamond on my dick so that's a diamond on her tongue,
I can't feel you baby 'cause I'm romantically numb,
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,
There's nothing on the God's sun that I haven't done,
I got a lot of problems gettin pussy just isn't one,
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,
Now they like potato chips I just cannot have one,
And I might like you for a minute,
But I don't like your friends in my business,
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping,
Uh uhhhhhhh,
I know you say you love me girl,
I know you say you love me girl,
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you,
Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,
I'm all-star team Jordan, small forward,
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,
How, How? Fuck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go,
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree,
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,
Wondering if I'm the best, Will I. Am, no Black Eyed Peas,
Girls wanna fuck ya niggas, guy don't wanna be you,
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,
I feel like I'll find a wife exactly when I need to,
You can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,
Uh uhhhhhhh,
I know you say you love me girl,
I know you say you love me girl,
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you 
 <SONGEND>

Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever
I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down
Every time I hit her up
When I get right
I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it
'Til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin' best

You the best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had

Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat
You know I'll be over there
(Yup!) I'll be over there
Shorty, I'll be over there
I'll be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
You ain't bringin' Drake along
You know that I'm workin'
I'll be there as soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waitin' room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused wit cause
Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister
Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot
I'm sayin'
Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it

 <SONGSTART> I gotta be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies, and that's okay
There's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say Yeah, normally, it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose the connection
'Cause I remember Stacy, she probably hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talked that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she'd get mad and want to go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She say I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her 'Even Photoshop couldn't change me'
But you-you-you You got me open, girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryin' to settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye-bye
No strings attached, your love is so WiFi
I gotta be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies, and that's okay
There's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say
My freak girl tell me now she a christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin girls off the bench like a "sixth-man"
I'm in the club doin the same ol' two step
While Omegas doin the same ol' que step
I had my money on my mind I was thinkin green
She a pledge, AKA she was pink and green
I wanna good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin game I was scrimmigin
My pimpinship so hard it needs censorship
I'ma chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin laid or gettin paid
I just know I'ma gettin one, the other's gettin away
I gotta be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies, and that's okay
There's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say

Man fuck 'em all, man we want it all

 <SONGSTART> Who else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Tell me today's weather
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lyin' to the kids, like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's
But I ain't playin' high school games
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's drive through lane
I'm too fly, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl on that McClaren, you gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
So then I gotta hide, what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damn
Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedastal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
Is why I gotta ask...
is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you and damn
I cant even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
This why I gotta ask
is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand (new)
Or is everything I'm doing too (late)
Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?
is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Show me if this is brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
yeah, yeah yeah...

Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedastal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new Brand new girl
This here is on some remix shit
It seems like everything I do, they're leaken it
And I hate hearin stories of who I'm sleepin with
That's why I gotta hide who I got in the ride
So she still think I'm confident and dumb
How long will this last? My life is on a pedastal
Am I movin too fast?
I feel like I'm in crazy competition with my past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, (brand new), brand new
(Is anything I'm doin) [same time] brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new girl

Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town

I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby
Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, you don't really have a choice
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?
You do so much more for them than me
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, uh, man, fresh up out the sand
February 10, it's the boy, but I'm still the man
Come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands
Then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you realâI don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the row
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17
Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down
Who's callin' my name? Who's involved now?
Tell me who I gotta down, I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn
Can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin' always duckin' my release date
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face
Damn, oh, triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think you niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
Six side, east side, all that for my area
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days.
I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust.
But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated.
Give some thought to this, because I'm confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.

If they come to Hidden Hills then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road, you could hit it wit' a stone
I be out here on my own, I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down, none of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town 'til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate, gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay, man, just stay up out my way

Skit around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one

Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from

I swear I get so passionate, y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm- I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down, none of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel, I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say, especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay, man, just stay up out my way

Skit around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one

Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew, this is serious.
I wish I wasn't famous
I wish I was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room, I would put it on you crazy.

Wow, I'm honored that you think this is staged
I'm flattered man, in fact, I'm amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are getting into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don't it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all coming, knew they would push a button
East egg hunting, they gotta look for something
Done doing favors for people
Cause it ain't like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas having trouble going gold
Turning into some so and so's that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I'm Corey Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I'm charged up
Oh no we eating, niggas ain't about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky legging
Trust me this information is vital
I'm trying to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there's something that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn't done you niggas any good
It's sound, sound, sound 'til the day I die
We going live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killing people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you 'bout to starve us?
Niggas ain't about to starve us
Nah, I'm charged up
(Stop, stop, stop, stop...)
Have you seen me?
I'm doing so good
Everytime I leave
Oh, I'm so sorry
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> [Chorus: Giveon]
Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you canâshowâme things
You knowâwhat it is, whenever I visit
Windyâcity, she blowing me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?
[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, truck to the plane, to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
It's presidential suite, on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touchdown, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you lead me in between?
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs'll look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women they come they go
Saturday, through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way
[Chorus: Giveon]
Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?
[Verse 2: Drake]
Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunning for the title
Lot of people trying to take us viral
I'm just trying to have a nice night, though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, "Babe, I think there was a typo"
Nah girl, I got it, that's light though
I can show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'till I'm back
Let me get your images, they last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access, cause you bad
You can go wherever with that ass
Show, to the shower, to the truck
Truck, to the club, for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watching
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women they come they go
Saturday, through Sunday, Monday
Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way
[Chorus: Giveon]
Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit

She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
She rode it like a, yeah, yeah

You don't wanna fall in love I know
I'm not someone you should trust I know
I give Chanel out like a hug I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier

 <SONGSTART> This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up
Burgular (?) they say I'm servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim
(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
(VERSE 2:)
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy
(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rose Mary? Even Leanne Sealey?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go", it's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like "why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a mothafucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fucking love
Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit
I swear it's sounding like home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it's not copy do it, it's the feel, you know?
It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians
them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth here
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I always wonder why you bother putting make up on
you dont need it
and even though i always tell you that you're beautiful
i repeat it
cause i dont want no singer i dont want no model
and i dont want no fashion designer or nothin

all you gotta do is come real shawty whats the deal
don't think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
i wouldnt have it any other way ay ay ayyyy
i know it 1 am but girl can i come over
she asked me if i'm sober, stop playing with me
you know i'm never sober and i'm already approaching
she try to say it be better if i leave baby please
i'm already down the street know you weren't expecting me
Oh you must think you look a mess
but i don't really think i could care bout nothin less
i just got to your address, i'm out the car and i am coming up the steps
she complain she dont want me to see her in her sweatpants
fk that st i just wanna work them sweat glands
beat it up beast like, muntant shit, x men
plus i already said i prefer you with no make up
made her face go down now her face stuck
made her pop a bean just to stay up

so you can get this hammer
come real shawty whats the deal
don't think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal

all that superficial st i dont need that
i like you just how you are dont make me repeat that
she said dont worry bout it and just to lean back
woo woo girl what you a beast at
her last nigga Z decieved her in her lane
J comes in to relieve her of her pain
cause i can stick it down like a needle in the flame
and then i go to work like a beaver in the rain
chase specialises in rekindling the flame
chase so good she catch a fever from the game
i just take over the delusions on her brain
take my pistol out and i just let it bang
come real shawty whats the deal
don't think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
i wouldnt have it any other way ay ay ayyyy
come real shawty whats the deal
don't think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
i wouldnt have it any other way ay ay ayyyy
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> We had the type of night where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same
Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib,
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru
Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, Crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, This Dedicated To Canada Man
The Whole Up North
A Lot Of People Don't Realize How Cold It Gets During The Winter
But Listen...
I Met This New Girl Late June Or Early July
I Called Her A Bunch Of Times But She Barely Replied
Now It's December, I'm Driving, And She's Like Where's My Hi?
I Swear, That I Never Called You Cause I Really Get Shy
See That Was A Segue, I Believe The Matter
Is What Happens After The Season Where The Leaves Just Scatter
Where The Timb Laces Get Tighter And Parka Hoods Flip Up
Drugs Dealers Standin And They Parka Hoods Slip Up
Where Girls Become Exes From Summer's Caught Ho'in
The Winter Cars Come Out, The Summer Cars Go In
And Some Places Is Breezy, And Some It Start Snow-Ing
And If You Planning Family Vacations You Better Know When
But Some Mothers Scared To Send They Daughters Out The City
Instead She Get A Sweater That She Bought Her Out Of Pity
Cause Mom Stays Up Late, She Seen Them Videos
Where Cancun College Students Pouring Water On Their Titties!
Yeah Man, It's A Funny Thing Going Through The Winter Up Here Man
A Lot Of Girls Y'know, Wanna Get Close. You Might Think They The One
But Just Wait, Nah Mean, Take It Slow
Forgot To Mention, This Girl That Never Gets To The Beach
She Lives Just West Of My Street, And So We Destined To Meet
Since I'm Driving, I Ask Her How To Get The Suite
She Doesn't Answer, Opens The Door And Just Gets In The Seat
She Throws Her Bag In The Back, And Starts Adjusting The Heat
She's Bold But I Roll With It, I'm Impressed Cause She's Sweet
Then She Says "I Heard Your Song And I'm Obsessed With The Beat,
I Mean, The Lyrics Are Cool, But I'm Obsessed With The Beat
I Love It When Voyce Sings And The Is Good,
There's A Couple Things In The Song That I Suggest You Repeat"
Off This I'm Kinda Takin *aback* For A Second,
I Get Her Number She Tells Me To Call Her After This Session
And So I Do, And It's Kind Of Awkward, The Surface Hard To Scratch
Until We End Up Sexin And Now My Heart Attached
I'm Thinkin Off I Should've Been More Southern
And Realizing All That She Wanted Was That Indoor Lovin And Ho!
Yeah, Uh, I Told Ya'll I Had A Story For You Right
Uh, Ya Man, It's What It Is
And Now, I'm Proud To Have Her Like Montreal To The Frizzench
She Love To Play Hurt Like Carter Did On The Bizzench
But, My Boy Say I'm Actin Different, Because I Lay Downtown
And I Still I Rush To Pick Her Up From Work And Fizzench
She Tellin Everyone Imma Hold Here Down
Tell Everyone I'm The Prince Up In This Cold Clear Town
And Stupid Me I Just Listen To Her,
Instead Of Wondering If This Is Really Gon' Last Me The Whole Year Round
But Then Spring Shows Up, And It's Dallas In This Bitch
The Weather Starts To Resemble The Holidays She Missed
When We Were Together It Seeming Like Way Back When
Ball Players Hop On The Plane And Make It Way Back In
See She Used To Play Piana, And Now She Never Wait For Santa
Instead Of Saving For Marriage, She Saving For Carrabanna
And It's A Shame, She Had Me Convinced That She Could've Been A Dime
I Guess, I Lost Another One To The Wintertime
I Miss You, Most Of Aaaallll, Myy Daarling
(Gimme A Second To Gather My Thoughts)
Strolling In The Park And Watching Winter Turn To Spring (Such A Beautiful Day Man)
(Yeah Man, You Know We Had To Switch It On 'em Right?)
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spring
(I'm Still Standing On Two Feet, Even After This Tragic Loss)
(Man, But I Got Something To Else To Tell Ya Baby)
I Remember Them Encore Pms, Breakfast And The Wake Up
Now Drake's Committed We Waiting On The Breakup
So We Can Get Back To Them Cognac Nights
With Dress Codes And Light Skinned Girls That Won't Act Right
And I Laugh Cause My Previous Lifestyle Was Quite Wild
The Winter Came And Blew His Cold Air Through
Back Then Light Sweaters And A Couple Drinks Might Get Her,
By The End Of The Week I Would Know *Their* Crew
And We'd Assembled A Trio, A Whole New Scene
With Three Ladies In The Shot We Never Broke Routine
At The End Of *that* *we'd* Cut When The Cameras Are Rollin
We Had Ladie's Hearts Always Gettin Damaged And Stolen
But This Summer Is Different It's A Two Man Operation
Granted The Fact That We One Man Short
Got Love For Him He Can Watch This New Man Stop A Nation
Cause Handin' Them Crack Is A One Man Sport
Instead Of Dress-Up, I Walk In Sweat Pants And *Charms* Clinkin'
I Find A Girl We Step Dance And Calm Drinkin'
The Face, The Breast, The Bras, The Toes
I'm Still Solo And A Long Night Draws To A Close
Cause It's A Fact, If She Come To The Crib And I Get Some Ass Inside
We'll Never Talk Again, Scary And True
That Song Special I Recorded With Voyce Well It's Like A Classified
It's What I'm Lookin For To Carry Me Through
Yet I Can't Seem To Find A *every* Girl That Possesses It
Only Wants A Friendship Causing Me To Forget The Shit
And When They Talk About They Past And Lovers
And You Get Mad At The Though Of *her* Giving Ass To Others
Yet You Find Peace With Yourself, Now Least There's Some Room To Ride
There's Also Room For Improvement As Soon As June Arrive
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spring
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spring
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spring

 <SONGSTART> [Verse 1]
Uh
Black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib telling ya girl that we should order in
& tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn
I'm so catch-trina smarter than a lot of these niggas
Swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water winnnnggggs
I'm still myself, suicide bars I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I'll bill myself and
I don't feel ya'll but I feel myselllf
& to those tell em' I deserve a mazeltov
I'm rappin like a shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blowâpause
And I can't hear the critics talking over the applause
Yeah
I tried to tell em', Future let em' know
Send the haters all my loveâX and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck
It's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than ya dreams are
I got ya dream girl riding in ya dream car
Yeah and the visual is stunning
I hope they document what I'm becoming
Congratulations
["oh" ad-libs]
[Verse 2]
So what you want an award or suttin?
I'm at the private airport boarding suttin'
I see nothin' from afar but I'm far from nothin'
Put on your poker face
I'll pull ya card if ya bluffinnnnn'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull ya card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin world recordsâno false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or suttin'
My deal like Weezy first weekâ1 point suttin'
And my verses getting stupider
Wayne if you're on Marsâcan you pick me up from Jupiterrrr?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down
When I When I break it dow-ownnnn
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But you could never be my assâpause
Again, damnit ya'll? Again?
Ya'll, pretend that we are some men that get it on and in
I'll die before I lose, cause I was born to win
If he don't fuck with ya'll, then don't bother him
and yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right... Uh
["oh" ad-libs]
[Verse 3]
It's like
These days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothing but a protÃ©gÃ©
But if you watched the VMA's there's nothing more to sayyy
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like ya bought a poppy
and damn how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow they say get it off your chestttt
And I'm what all the fuss about and if they talking
I bet I'm what they discussion bout
Hit me at the officeâsame extension
Consider me the reason ya'll should pay attention
[Outro: Lil Wayne]
It's crack
A yo Drizzyâyou shoulda said that on the hook
You shoulda been like: "congratulations"
It's crack
Yeah
It's crack (ha ha)
Congratulations

 <SONGSTART> Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with this time will be different
Oh the ideas is fun, oh the ideas is fun
Oh the idea is soooo fun everytime
At least we try for a run everytime
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'
She just wanna run around the city and make memories that she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelin's like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She used to say
"You can be whoever you want, believe in yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things, and not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging, (aye)
Don't talk to me like I'm famous (aye)
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up I be dressed before we hung up
I take Englington to 401 East end
Exit at Malcom road and the East end
Where all the pretty girls are sleepin'
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late cause this nigga's creepin and I like how we're
creepin
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours."
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

My old flex is my new flex now and we're workin' on it, yeah

Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, then made history
Tell them imma need reservations for 20

She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it for the drama
I got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up
I'm terrible at inviting myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else call me over
You can be the one to take control call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me
Why you keep askin' me about her?
Couple of other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now
Told you about giving him chances on chances on chances
He's not holding you down, he's holding you back right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me oh

Remember one night I went to Erykah Badou house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life can really be for me
She said when that shit is real you just know
And I was thinking about you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me, that's my nigga till we gon'
Keeps his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already
Girl's talkin' bout you, gotta leave already
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you a little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said, "You're mine," I was yours already
22, had the Bentley 4 door already
Even as a boy I was the boy already
So you know that mean the pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I've matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get the rewards already
Know I do this shit for 3rd Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time cause I've lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends asking where you stand with the boy
FaceTime saying you got plans for the boy
Studying your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, another xan for your boy
You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy
You would probably kill another man for the boy
You would probably...
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you I ain't never got to worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy
Yeah... Why...

 <SONGSTART> [Drake Talking]
I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man.
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I like to uh
I like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess I'll call her one of my most recent addition to my collection of female disappointments you know
[Verse 1:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes u Ant Viv
Until u take from me till the point that u can't give.
And when I see u out I pass by it's offensive
But what u expect tho
Kinda direct yo
Cuhz all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy that tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cuz Now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
[Speaking]
let me see what im gonna say for the second one yeah i got it hold on uh
[Verse 2:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that ya'll believe in
Cuhz when I say I'm serious you claim u only Teasin
I plan a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple of years i guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin waitin patient
For her to be ready to love and leave her drama
Cuhz I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losin a feeling
U losin appealing
U need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
[Verse 3:]
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But u was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin ya thing to
Sayin to my self u deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
And fact I know you always be lyin when u be leavin
Goin to visit family promise me u ain't cheatin
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that u a soft nigga
How u think cuddling with its cute
They laugh at how u think u last when u really don't
And make u think u get the ass when u really wont
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin it
So sign your name on a pre-nup and in initials
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
[Drake: talking]
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
Slacker It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter its just its life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about
ha ha ha you know what it is man
its drake,slacker,dilla rest in peace
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention
Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

Bitch, I'm a demon in the night

I call Drake and tell him off 'em (Drake)
Ayy, I call Drake and tell him off 'em (What?)

London, man, I need me a thick bitch (A thick)
And a Louis bag just so I can fit me the grip in (Grip)

She wanna fuck, but I ain't with it
Headshot, knock him off his fitted
Punch him out, send that boy to that dentist
Talkin' Henny, it better be PrivilÃ¨ge, ayy
Baow, what?
It better be PrivilÃ¨ge

[Drake:]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires
[Future:]
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to Messiah
I'm in that '81 and this that '82, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city
You actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I shoulda moved you away from Houston
Before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string
[Drake:]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you (Find you)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires
Ayy, self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from they serve, the soda gleam (Gleam, gleam, gleam)
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap
And I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric to go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handled it
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires
Ooh, shortie you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? Oh
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lot of secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, shoulda stayed silent
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Deja vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Deja vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Deja vu, deja, deja
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> What you mean I ain't call you?
I hit you when I landed
I'm waiting in my hotel room
seems like we are arguing more and it's getting less romantic
yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
but I f-cked you right I will
I f-cked you right I will
I'll f-ck you like no-one has ever ever made you feel
I mean it's part of our relationships, amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay for real
you looking mad, girl for goodness sakes
you with all those curves and me without no breaks
ooh, I'm willing to work it out however long it takes you
you feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
your friends always tying up every line on your phone
yeah but tell them b-tches that you'll always be my missus
and the hardest part about the f-cking business is minding your own
uhh, and everytime I try and break it off
we just yell until we tired then I break you off
it's useless all this fighting lets get past it now
even when I throw them deuces you just send it back around
Your wrist and fingers glisten
ice cold like Michigan
eh look at what we living in
here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you aint listening
rather run around with them nothing ass b-tches
then, go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
we used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemy's
deep inside it's killing me
but soon its gon be killing you
to see her in that two seater, now thats gon hurt your feelin's boo
ah ha, didn't you think you would be over me
by now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
she spoke her piece I know, capisce
so love must be let go, released
into the wind, again again and deuces I must throw ya peace
You know what, yo?
you a bitch!
you should have a travel agent cuz you a trip
you should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
but all you got is some f-cking issues you f-cking b-tch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
give her a kiss for me, her second son
get your mind right baby or get your sh-t together
you gon be hot a little while
I'mma be rich forever
girl seduce us, they come in Deuces
when I cut em off they always become a nuisance
n-ggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
he just took my old b-tch and turn it to his new b-tch
hehe. I'm stupid
but I won't get my drama on
what I'm dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
so when you talk bout "you know who" I don't know who you talkin' bout
According to my old b-tch I be on some new sh-t
she was on some old sh-t, now I got a new b-tch
think I give two sh-ts
you aint gon do sh-t
meet my two fingers,...deuces
if you knew better you'd do better
wanna get the middle finger but I got two better
So you gon diss me even though you know it's wrong
know you gon (miss me a little when I'm gone)
Drizzy voice, now I'm ghost baby
four door Rizzy Royce
tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm bout my business boys
plus I make paper
come on thats old news
yesterday's paper
oh, you talkin', what about?
if it aint how I kept you studded out
you might as well shut ya mouth
you'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
act like there's gum in your hair girl, cut it out
The farewell email from a female
but I'm a playa, aint gon tell you all the details
what it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
by the seashore, but she's not a bore but neither a whore
who needs to know more
the kind you can't ignore but want to open the door... for
or run in your favourite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it aint your's
I did things for, aint rich aint poor
I want it to do more but hell I just aint know her
well enough to know if this is all she came for
but enough to know tonight excited she came four
times to my cousins house to see if I was there
get ya minds out the gutter man
we out here tryna have a good time
and here I am, all heavy with the words where
somebody thats a nerd, likely fast forward
but sh-t they asked for it
it's hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know it's juicy
you start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive stop making sad songs
Im on some new shit
Im chuckin my deuces up to her
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART>  <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I'm at a stage in my life where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything
Sipping on Dom PÃ©rignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace, bought a case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
And you know what I need from you when I get home
You better not be on the phone
Talking up a storm like you usually do
Talking up your friends like you usually do
Telling them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time we been
Sipping on Dom PÃ©rignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace, bought a case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come buy the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely wanna
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You know
How we let it get like this I don't know
But that nigga can't save your soul, nah
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't a nigga heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Ungrateful, ungrateful
Your momma be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful
I'm too good for you, too good for you
You should go back to a perfect match for you, unstable
Doing me dirty (dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous
I haven't even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
Ungrateful
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> My dope in the bushes
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I did the digital dash
I fuck your bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to your momma tho
Out in the streets like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'mma kid of my word
A hustler the first to the first
These bitches be naggin the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed her my racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack on muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a 6-trey
Chevy, Mercedes I keep em' comin'
Fuck all these bitches I keep em' comin'
I pull up right now I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You don't come around here cause its dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, thats a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and thats confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that cock trip
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got big with my bag with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she lash on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom, we did it
I see how they countin' this out
Bet they ain't never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin, I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I bought up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga do you really mean it
When I was sleepin' on the floor you shoulda seen how they treat me
I pour the Actavis and pop pills so I can fight the demons
I did the digital dash
I fuck the bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to lil mama
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'mma kid of my word
A hustler the first to the first
These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is, if you get hit you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again, I don't let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again
And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on a Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that's making triple what I'm making, what an entrance
That's when you know its a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I
I did the digital dash
I fuck the bitch on the passenger
I give the junky a blast
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> [Verse]
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wylie's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us
But like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solana show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Caterin' is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like SureÃ±os
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira
[Outro]
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Somebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded, well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
Probably why Im back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it
Tonight I'm into breaking up
Somebody's home
I'm drunk as ever
I'm not alone, I, I, I, I, I'm with my people
I know you love it
I don't just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair Pinot Grigio
Baby forget about it
Im headed wherever this muthf-cking jet is routed
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it
My judgements never clouded
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I'm about whatever man
I'm tryna f-ck with tinkerbell in never neverland
But I'm polite about it
Baby after you
I've had a glass or too so
Somebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
Probably why I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it
Tryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where'd I just put my bow tie
Millionnaire multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just always say the cost of livin
I love from it though, I've been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love i dont think should happen
Becuase everythings easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafia, still run the commitee
NY forever n-gga, Diddy,
Somebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it

Watch me do it
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Uh... yea, alright. well alright. well alright. uhuh. yeah. ...feels good.
It's a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado for the girl who's a student, and her friend who's a model.
Finish the whole bottle, and we gon do it big like this... yea, and he was just practice.
He aint in your world, you can take him off your atlas.
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card, and baby you can max this, ah-out.
Show me where your tats is.
Show me where your heads at; maybe I can grasp it.
They say if you get her, you can understand her better
And she's known to be a cheater, but that's only if you let her.
And I got it together.
So when they talk and try to deter me, it's like whatever.
Tell em I appreciate the help, but I just gotta know for myself.
Ayo, ayo, ayo...
This lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya.
Especially when you think no one's understandin ya.
These girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder
Clickin they cameras.
Snap, snap, snap, until they runnin outta card space.
You remind me of Tony's sister in Scarface.
Just take it easy on love, and slow your heart rate.
Goodness gracious, the top is such a hard place. Yeah.
But if you never even been there, it kinda makes sense why you dyin to pretend, dear.
Spillin all your drinks, and takin pictures in your swimwear.
Head up in the clouds, you survivn on the thin air.
I know that shit is exhaustin, girl... and your mistakes are costin, girl...
And maybe you don't need the help, but I just gotta see for myself.
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with Ian Throw
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on a rotary phone
I take a glass, it don't mean, "Nah, don't go with me home."
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me, and frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is set around competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life
 <SONGEND>

I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me, and frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is set around competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

 <SONGSTART> Aye, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' (stressin' over somethin')
You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
(Girl, your love, you think you broke it)
(I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart)
(Girl, your love, you think you broke it)

Five years later how am I the man still
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side bitch we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yelling out "pay the guys"
Man I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya

Aww man, aww man, aww man, man
You know I had t-
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure my people are gettin' by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas will take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep egging me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
No offense cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on makin' records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talkin' crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound
That'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say "Okay if you say so"
See whatever I say goes
I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I can never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?
They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence you can really get it
I mean forreal, girl you know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to
Oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
Draft day, Johnny Manziel

That's why I don't read the news, it's garbage
And the editor that wrote the thing, he's garbage
Got guys on my back about schedule, saying it's too tough

It's the SEC!
Heck, you pledged, didn't ya?
Go play intramurals, brother
Go play intramurals
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a they sing along with me, momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness,
and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down,
I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

 <SONGSTART> Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeh, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell em I love em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates I send the Maybach out the neighbourhoods, they never seen it
That shit is dangerous but it so convenient
I aint lying, yeah
And comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italian, some fly shit
It's sittin' at the house like I bought it in '9-6
Cause honestly I'm too f-cking busy to drive stick
I swear, too f-cking busy, too busy f-cking
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me
Preheated oven, I'm in this so
But I aint finished though
It's been a minute though
My newest girl back home, got issues with parents
And some charges, how the f-ck can I get her to Paris
Luckilly, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled surprised I wasn't surprised
Thats only cause I been waitin' on it, nigga
So f-ck whoever hatin on a nigga
Of course
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Don't?
Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympia's
We talked music for hours she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB these niggas make it so hard to be friendly when I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga so far these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ohh, I never seen the car you claim to drive
Shit I seen it, you just aint inside
And I feel like lately I went from top 5 to remaining 5
My favourite rappers either lost it or they aint alive
And they tryna bring us down me, Weezy and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage, dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, it wasnt a lie
Yeah, just have some good p-ssy waiting on a nigga
And f-ck whoever hatin' on a nigga
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me

 <SONGSTART> [Intro]
I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay
[Verse]
So if you rebuke me for working with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's making your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours, then let him repeat
Now, you popping up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all putting pen to the sheets
Tired of sitting quiet, and helping my enemies eat
Keep getting temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spitting image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well, I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle and hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to their higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learning, yeah
Your brother said, it was your cousin then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happening lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger working double time
Ya'll acting like he made the boy when I was trying to help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly making me hits, but then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it, my spirit did it
I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you running behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playing with my name and I'ma let it ring on you
Like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> [Chorus]
(Ayy)
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in better weight, thinkin' how'd I make-
[Post-Chorus]
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)
[Verse: Drake & French Montana]
If you need me, you can't call me
I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind
All I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance, then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes when I was with Ms. Craten
That lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favorites, it feels amazin' (yeah)
[Chorus]
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This for life, bih, we can never separate
I'm in better weight, thinkin' how'd I make-
[Post-Chorus]
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
[Outro]
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me I begin to write the thesis
Freddy got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marine Land, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer I'ma be tweakin'
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> You've got me feeling emotions
Higher, ooh
You've got me fe-
You've, oh
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask is there anybody like me?
You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
You've got me fe-
You, oh-h
Aye
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I'm tryna see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underage
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shi-
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but, who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then
You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
Aye
Higher, higher
You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
Aye
Higher, higher

Every time I see 'em somethin' wrong with they memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga

Went from my nigga serving it by the tele
To venues in Manchester just swerving with Balotelli
The fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassin'
They even bring up these niggas make the comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted?
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became somethin'
Girls that becoming ladies
And my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city
This shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This the shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know
Can't you talk to me
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby
Sometimes you are, all alone
But there's no doubt
So don't just shut me out
Cause that's not what love's about
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(Wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(Wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(Yea wassup)
Came too far to give up
Gotta try, cause I can't do it on my own
Can't you talk to me
Tell me what you need
Can't you talk to me
Tell me what you need

 <SONGSTART> Feel you, feel me
Our souls are connected
By you, I am
Spiritually infected
Touch me
You're touching yourself
I'm you,
And you are me as well.
Most of us do it to live
But some just live to do it
Either way,
We're all into this
Erotica revolution
Explode
Everybody let go
Come on now
What we need
Erotica revolution
Is to release
Erotica revolution
You want
You need
My elixir
You're fixed.
Love me
Feel me
In me both can exist
Wild, saint
Chaos and control
I am tattooed on your soul.
Most of us do it to live
But some just live to do it
Either way,
We're all into this
Erotica revolution
Explode
Everybody let go
Come on now
What we need
Erotica revolution

 <SONGSTART> D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Somethin spinnin fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if ya ears a virgin id advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't couchere and this shit isn't christian
It's that muthafuckin heat you can find up in kitchen
Girl holla at yo nigga I got that shit for low
Ok maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride ya'll
We all of age and I ain't got nothin to hide ya'll
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb
Every record that I've done the station hear em play it
This the city that I run this the shit that I created
They tellin me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearin thangs cause I'm feelin like I'm faded
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded

 <SONGSTART> Pay attention, its on
Staring at my city lights through the plain window as I write this song
Have faith, when I do it
Imma do it bigger than they think
I don't just flow I over flow I be filling up the sink
Like I left the water on I run this bitch if anybody ask
Aint much change since high school
N-ggas still be in and out of class
S class or the brand new cl5 on them haters
Black paint, chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders
I just said that cause I'm not with california near the studio with taz
You should give us credit n-ggas killin people we can be all doin that instead.
But we not, we just kill the summer every single time I come around
Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them n-ggas tryin to run em down
Not I, not me, YMOB, call jaz, call c,
Bet both of them would agree
Get viewed, get judged, get booed, get loved
Shit get done round here, do you, not us
I'm gon do what I want
Cause this lifes made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
I'm gon do what I want
Cause this lifes what I'm given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds
Once upon a time I met
On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this
But tell me who chose this,
Sin citys innocent really when its inside my mind
And co-sign with a rhyme and a big pen
Once again its an even odd
Cant applaud with one hand
Cant be God with one fan
Or can you stan you
If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that
Now I sip that lightly when I'm on my mic tightly
And I write nightly like Spike Lee
Let me break it down
I been having a maid since the 8th grade with a fade
Rapping by the swings
And the bell never really rings
Class in session there's no recession
For this upper echelon mic testing its
K-dash-O-S F-R-E-S-H in the place
With a grace in and outta space
Gotta race
Don't be something that you really not
Sabotage the universal plot
When the planet earth rock gets hot
From the sun don't get got just get God yeah see that
(Do you believe)

That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed

I want to get straight to the climax
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back

Tell that nigga back back

Watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a motherfucking legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga rapping
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
I'm up first, I'm on tour
Got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas
Now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish
Make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'ont know who we are
Fuck em all, they only pussy niggas shooting at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong
When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words
Watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a motherfucking legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga rapping
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D I'm the holy one
Yeah, you know what's up
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go

Tell that nigga back back

 <SONGSTART> Take you back,
Take you back,
That was such a lie.
Every time you said you loved me, you can't look me in my eyes,
And I beg you for the truth, so much goin' thru my mind,
And my father did just pass, to make my problems multiply,
And I know nobody's perfect, but you finally crossed the line,
And I gave you everything, but you was never satisfied,
And you said I was the one, just like you told another five,
Feel like it's a competition against all these other guys.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
Every time I see you, feels like time is moving slow,
It's unfortunate for me, I have some trouble letting go,
Even though it's in the past, I just felt like you should know.
And you hate me when I get high, but you're the reason that I smoke.
Girl quit playin',
Girl quit playin',
You ain't love me from the start,
You're the reason that I feel this way,
You broke my fuckin' heart,
And I gave you all my trust, but you just tore it all apart,
Now you're all I think about while I'm layin' in the dark.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.

Been a couple months and you're beggin' for me back,
And I love all the attention, I'm not sure how I should act,
And you're saying that you miss me, I refuse to say it back,
Even though I still do want you, I don't have the time for that,
'Cause these women stay the same, while this nigga's chasin' cash,
And your problems are so small, girl just trust me they ain't bad,
'Cause you cryin' bout a nigga while I'm cryin' bout my dad,
And its eating me alive, should've taken me instead.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.

In the bathroom, flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds, preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh, you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in

Like voila, you do it right, he just might buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.O.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R 'n B singer
Make it ring finger, M3 beamer
Champagne Range, triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags

They tell me time is money, well, we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner, you all don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it, I ain't never get to ask

 <SONGSTART> This is why I do this shit
I think they call this, venting
Look,
This is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil' Bruh? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for mil
Equal opportunity rappin', that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been gettin' high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts this is all a nigga knows
And everytime I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I will be performin' this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine:
Don't believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isn't new.
So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if tears hold value
Then I will drop one for every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, Forty, O and Neek standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned about they profit
From this million dollar scheme
Just know that I'm in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh yeah
Look.
Fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chillin' here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there
sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown
And now security follows me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.

You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me
I try with you
Yeah
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we should have just did things my way
Instead of the other way
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you

How the story go
You just jumped my style
You just stole my flow
You just seen me out
You gets no hello
And you wonder why?
Man you know, you know
Yeah, and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in '02
And everybody saying I'm the man
So true
Yeah, but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors
A space to put awards
A couple of parking spots
And maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted
And women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it
I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playing like I'm being scouted till I'm out it
Game time bitch
I hope your proud of us
King James shit
Watch me throw the powder up
This old G got my whole suite clouded up
And I bet you I be outta time before I'm outta luck
They ain't rooting for me
They ain't clapping for me
I'm only saying iwhy can't someone be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue
But you know, you know
This is hard right
Please make your long story shorter
Cos time is at the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talking
I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we get these flights and don't get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the alcalays
I'm the real reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my tax is paid
And I'm still spitting money from my active days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 digit budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I could pull some fucking strings
So at courtside when I'm wrong get a fucking ring
Yeah, I bet I'll be there, I'll be there
You see that 62 sitting outside
That's me there
I'm jumping to the time that's my leap year
Prepare
Putting in that overtime
I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishing that I could of done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurting
I got new girls but none of their love is for certain
I call old girls but none of their numbers are working
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change
You have to adjust
How come when I gotta carter you stare at me in disgust?
I say it's just to have fun
You should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flying through the door
I can't ignore
The paparazzi outside trying to record
Why's every woman never down here before?
Am I the only 23 year old, why can't I soar?
The rough child, the crews, the guy thats in the open seats
It's always nice when your out with someone who notices
A condo, got that art gallery openings
I'm just hoping that isn't what my hoping is
They ain't rooting for me
They ain't clapping for me
I'm only saying why can't someone just be happy for me?

 <SONGSTART> Yeah
I never really talk about dick that I wanna give you
Or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, head grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like
Like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kay's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hitting, soothing
Keep it right there, no moving
Make my way around the bases
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (high)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willing and ready for the taking
Earth shattering, groundbreaking
Head scarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare, but just be prepared that
I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now
Well, what now?
Did somebody â who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixing potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it
Oh, you
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixing potion

Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah
Turn everything up a little more
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie
I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright
Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all the
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (yeah)
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things will get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this
It takes some finesse

Let's just keep it private
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside
You a real ass woman and I like it

Yeah
I been waiting on this one Charlie, for real
I've been waitin' Driz
I've been waitin', let's get 'em bro
Nah, for real
Shout out Boi-1da too
Mm, I like that
Let's get 'em Driz
You don't have a drink, you're not drinking or what?
I got a drink bro
Hahahaha, I like that
I got my drink right here. Cheers my bro
Toast up man
Yeah, okay, yeah
[Verse 1: Drake]
Goldman Sachs, they wanna hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories about how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin'
My niggas really made somethin' from nothin'
Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin', never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make sure the staff are paid well
Make 'em think twice 'bout the stories that they tell
No one knows when the plan is hatchin'
I'ma let 'em walk on eggshells
Tiptoe, niggas better know
[Interlude: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!
Yeah
Got his foot on your neck man
What time is it? What time is it? It's like two in the morning right now
Yeah, well it's real late over here
It's me and Charlie, that's it, you hear me? We got the whole building to ourselves
We got the building. Kill them again, kill them again Driz, kill them!
[Verse 2: Drake]
Y'all keepin' the score while watchin' me score
Y'all keep the awards, I'll take the rewards
If y'all goin' for fun, I'll stay and record
But if y'all goin' to war I'm there for sure
Wouldn't miss it
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin' like New Edition
That's these guys
Us guys don't wear New Balance or Levi's
Key West retirement plan
Grippin' the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin' balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
October Firm the new chain of command
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill' hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shorties'd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, I'm in hot rotation
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin' shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have 'em playin' innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin' dreams
So it's best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah
[Outro: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Drizzy Drake! You're an animal Drake! You already know that you an animal bruh! Animal!
I'm saucy!
Saucy! You just stepped out of the club straight into the booth like it's light. Tear up the ting in one take!
Showed up for you, you know what I'm sayin'?
My brother Drizzy
My brother, you already know
Wow. And you know what it's like. You stepped out the club into the booth to prove to everyone why you number one bro. Why you got your foot on their necks!
Nah for real. I stepped in here, SN1, OVO, Fire in the Booth, Charlie Sloth. Come on. The official. I rock with the official. I'm on official ting, you know what it is man. Come on, come on
Ayy bro, it feels like that's another moment there, you know what? Like, I got to say this to you on the real bro. The way that you've embraced British culture will be remembered forever. And the UK love you. The real G's over here, you know that bro. When you go to your parties, you see who's in your parties
Nah, you know what it is, of course
It's the certies
Nah, listen, but listen. It's a family and it's a big family, you know what it is. I'm just happy to be home, like I said man
My brother, man. Foot on neck time
Yo, are these guys dumb? You see the big man Charlie too, oh my goodness
My brother Drizzy. I can hear these rappers' prayers man
Nah, I'm heated for you right now
They're like, Yo, please tell Drizzy to take his foot off my neck!
Nah, I'm heated right now man, oh my goodness. Shout out French Montana, my brother, you know what I'm sayin'? The big wave, yeah. Shout out Huncho, Quavo. Shout out Offset, blessings on the new ting. Oh my goodness. Shout out, yo-. I could go for hours. Charlie, come on man
Ayy, you could go for hours. I was at your party the other night, I've seen who was there. I'm like, Woah! There's a lot of people, there was a lot of faces in that party
Nah, I don't wanna hear no chat for the whole 18 about Charlie Sloth. Are you dumb? Alright. Jheeze, jheeze
And that right there: one take. A real moment right there
Yeah, jhee!
And that's Fire in the Booth my guy!
And I'll be back January-February part two, you know what time it is. Come on!
Okay, okay

Come on! You know I've applied for your passport, right?
Hahaha. I need that
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART>  <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go?
From the concrete, who knew that a flower would grow?
Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracin' it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
As you can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's on but it's lookin' like July four
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off like
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you fuck with me
Who coulda predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me, luckily
What happened between us that night, it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags wanna cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it, though
You never see it coming you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I see it in her eyes, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off like
Everything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she sayin' she more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me, where is the magic?
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I wanna witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off like
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine
Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo
Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
Hey, ever, ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who we're about to kill
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn't
You are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
Okay, hello it's da Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine

Overthrowing your pain
Using you high to be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release
And in your wake, ripple your sweet voice
And more chune for your head tops
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was staying up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Dom RosÃ© toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake, though
Miraval to the face, though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows and front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin' our name on a double cup
We ain't even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin' me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It's bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me pay it no mind
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!

Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
Tell a bad bitch, "Girl let's go hang", you know me: Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO gang, get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range, I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches, Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows got new flows, rap is stress, but it pays great
Pimp flows and screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Let me go on and hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast so give me anything to make shit go slow
Money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin name on you when I go, you'll still be mine
You'll still be mine, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin name on you, let em know you love the boy, what's up
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
Simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker free no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My mama still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playing
Tap dance to my drum roll
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin name on you when I go, you'll still be mine
You'll still be mine, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin name on you, let em know you love the boy, what's up
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you, there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up with some old shit to drivers opening doors
This my town if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all, that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make due with what's left
Yeah I do this shit to the death, yeah I do this shit til I'm gone
I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real, what's up
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin name on you when I go, you'll still be mine
You'll still be mine, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin name on you, let em know you love the boy, what's up

I'm bout it, I'm bout it, I'm standin' on these couches
Sayin' "bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch! "

Never embellish, believe him 'cause he exist
There's stars on my team but I lead the league in assists
Never been a believer that previously exists
I wonder what I'd be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your ooo-old man
He couldn't of done it like this sho' 'nuff

 <SONGSTART> What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple nas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G. Been a East Side ting. Scarborough ting from time, G, been have up di ting dem from time, G. So I don't know what's wrong with these little wasteman out here eh? Y'all need to know yourself."
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show their face now
What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now
Nothing really changed, but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothing was the same
I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I just been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect Like everyone I know
And I hate that you don't think that I belong to ya
Just too busy running shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it
I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
Now you hate me, stop pretending
Stop that fronting, I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Girl you know I seen ya naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay remniscing and makeup sex is tradition
But you've been missing girl and you might feel like nothing was the same
I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect

I just been drinking on the low

Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up 'fore I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more y'all niggas build and destroy
Y'all niggas party too much man I just chill and record
No filler you feel it now if you ain't feel it before
Yes Lord

And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, ask apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never, I don't get bitter I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled hey bitches
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl that's just freako
Please don't cuss girl that don't suit you

Damn shame am I overexpressin the game
Should I hold back on addressin the lane
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm tranna clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And every since I've been messing with wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was goin nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
Drake was at the club and he bald like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve and I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it
And all you talkin ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it
And all you women that I fucked get over it

I slapped my girl, she called the feds

I had to take em to that ghetto university

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Look
I know girls love BÃ©yonce
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing and shawty you ain't no different
These days its hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like its just me, but Im not alone
But if you're alone then, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you (2x)
Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
and startin some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys round me saying, Get money and fuck these hoes
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
Cause we don't wanna hide no more and plus your not shy no more
Neither one of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

 <SONGSTART> [Verse 1: Drake]
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor, tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO, D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again, return of the mack again
"Deceiving" was cool, I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin one of my rappa friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' you know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me... little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best decisions you've made
I'm sunnin' them all, I live in the shade
Previously mischievious behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited to degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, kinda adult shit
I am talkin all day shoppin sprees in the mall
With friends that I ball with
Hear me: Trey's girl go and get me some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise, I will kill this song til it actually dies
With military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best til the stats arrive
At all these a-list parties you fratranize
Where you can't wear hats inside only slacks and ties
Bu you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best
[Chorus:]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
There ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
[Verse 2: Trey Songz - rap]
(It's The Prince, look here)
Yep it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exibitor
Play me I'll visit ya, lay ya in critical condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin with a fly face, slim face, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos, now we got the city froze
Somethin like my wrist be, niggas know how dis shit be
Step to the club, security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor, dey give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy, straight no cubes
Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patron to the face til he wasted
I'm blowin til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
All me Mister Anderson huh I'm ramblin
But at the same time, I'm spittin a flame rhyme
Baby what's you're name, hey call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's gametime
We could take a couple shots, break down ya d'z
Take it to the hole, post up on me
Let me feel the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya
[Chorus:]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
There ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
[Verse 3:]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Fresh up on the scene
Big blunt full of green
Fitted to the back, 'Ginia be on the map
Virginia on the back of the hat while I mack
Ay shawty you phat and I love that
Big stage, and I holla "where dem thugs at? "
Fellaz hit me and they holla "where the drugs at? "
I'm a charge a nigga fifty for the a dub sack
Fuck v.I.p. cus the bithes all ova a nigga
And the weed all ova he liquor
I mean the liquor all over the weed
Shit, a nigga all ova da B
And the flames all ova da feez
And I be all ova da streets

Gettin money ain't nuthin to me babae
Say no, and you frontin to me

When I give ya what I give ya
[Chorus:]

Bad things, it's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'

Yuh, ayy, ayy
She said, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love Mahbed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store clothes
And blow the fee from my last 4 shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me & the salesman build a rapport so
He understands the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash only, transactions homie
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dnt know I bought it
I been doin this for years homie, thoroughly I thought it
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track admitting most of my Currency's imported
But too late now, it too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if they're were acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker
Playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A real Menschkeit as they say he's a legal bender
And ATF is present every regal memeber
The coalition, is so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Use to record in the basement that rennie grew his piff in
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen'
'til I mention I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, NIGGA
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I'm equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
I try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
They condo that I just purchased is sound vacant
Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life

On another time zone, we party 'till the morning
My man looking up to me, he 'bout to sneeze
And she treating me like I be New Year's Eve
Counting down the seconds untill she sees me (5, 4, 3, 2)
One time for the women that wound up with Megan Fox
Two times for the ladies that never use Photoshop
Them other girls, they so vanilla
You gotta suit of Je ne sais quoi
They need to get their French up to part
And, uh, pardon me for asking
Anything I want, I must have it
I make it happen, poof, magic
[Chorus:]
I'm trying to make sure that you feel right

[Drake - Verse 1]
Summer's mine
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'mma need it back
I wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl
Should I be tired of taking care of me right now?
[Hook]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
[Verse 2]
Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, but don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town
But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows
[Hook]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long

You should go, before you stay too long

 <SONGSTART> [Verse: Bishop Brigante]
It`s Fucking Losers Like You, That Make Me Do What I Do
Make Me Hate Where I`m From, You As Fake As They Come
Everybody Got Guns, Who The Fuck Gonna Squeeze
Everybody Got Sars, You Ain`t Fucking With These
Why You Wish To Be Ghetto, Tell Me What`s It About
Why You Trynna Get In Where I`m Trynna Get Out
Why Won`t You Just Be Yourself, Why Won`t You Tell Us The Truth
Like How You Only Load Guns When You Up In The Booth
You Ain`t Nothing To Shoot, You Don`t Even Exist
You Just A Fantasy, Family As Weak As It Gets
You Ain`t Speakin A Bitch, Cause I Don`t Listen To Chicks
I Don`t Argue With Broads, Cause I`m Really A Pimp
But I Will Tell You This, As Far As Y`all Are Concerned
Pull Out My Santa Clause, And Make The Holidays Burn
You Can Call Me The Grinch, Cause Y`all Are Nothing But Hoos
Just Another Bunch Of Phony Acts With Nothing To Prove
[Verse: Ken Masters]
Ahaha Yo
Now Let The Kids Grill At The Rider`s Ride (Ride)
We Spending All Day, These Niggas Idolize (Aha)
They Claim They Want Fame Nigga So We Decided That We Gon Make `em Some Stars Until The Drama Dies
But They Can Go Back To They Holes Where They Mama Lies
Or Write More Lies About They Drugs, Guns Or Homicides
Funny, Claim The Thug Life That They Abiding By
Run The Corner Then They Turn Into The Silent Type, Wanna Conpremise
My Niggas We Ride Or Die
And Roll With The Bitches That Got They Body Right
These Niggas Ain`t Built Ain`t Got The Body Type
Time To Break A Nigga`s Spirit Like The Amistad, Trynna Fool The Audience (Who Run It)
Feel The Ambience, Stars In The Presence, Kings Of The City Are Appalled By The Peasants
Ain`t Gotta Say Names, We Can All Get A Reference
Brains In The Info From Your Broads In The West End
Masters, Flowing Staggers On Bars
Nigga Stay Mad Cause His Swagger`s On Mars
Y`all Niggas Ain`t Thinking We Callng Y`all Tards
Claim You Want War, Okay, On Guard
[Verse: Young Tony]
Ayo, Hey You Mr. Rapper Guy (You)
When You In The Booth, Tell Me Why You Have To Lie (Why)
Come On, Spit The Truth
All I Hear Is Bang Bang, Hustle This, Hustle That (Lying)
But If You Hustle Crack, Then Where The Money At ?
No Proof, Dr Seuss, Story Telling When He Rhyme Like
Once Upon A Time I Was Really On The Grind
There`s Another Lie, Couldn`t Out-Hustle Me
Hating When It Come To D, I Can Take You`re Starting 5
I`m Only Goin At Generic Rap Niggas That,
Rap About Ki`s But Couldn`t Show Me 10gs,
And These Niggas Dry Snitching On They Tees,
Standing Out, Like A Sore Thumb To The D`s,
My Niggas Please, If You Really Had Work,
You Would Do What You Do And Wouldn`t Put It On Your Shirt,
It Makes My Heart Hurt When Dumb Niggas Act Hood,
You Ain`t No Hustla, Just A Nigga That Can Rap Good
[Verse: Jonny Roxx]
See There`s A Height Requirement, Nigga To Mention My Name (Smarten Up)
How The Fuck You Little Niggas Can`t Stay In Your Lane
Man You Offered Me A Truce And I Took It (Aigh)
Now I Hear This Bullshit So How The Fuck Am I To Overlook It
Look If This Little Nigga Survive Then It Gotta Be God
How The Fuck Are You A Hustla With Your Factory Job ?
And I Dont Get It, Nigga Im A Fucking Diabetic
And I Don`t Usually Eat Y`all Sweet Niggas
Evertime I See Y`all Retard Niggas Y`all Bitch Out
Waddup Roxx ? Now We Cool ? Then You Dip Out
Talkin All That Bang Bang Shit, Pull A Clip Out
Sayin` You A Blood, Next Week You Prolly Crip Out
I`m Saying, We Don`t Believe Y`all Niggas (Nah)
G-35, X5 Nah Niggas (Yeah)
This Here Is A Public Announcement For My Niggas (Yeah)
No More Goodnight, Good Morning, Goodbye Niggas
[Verse: Jd Era]
I Don`t Appreciate Niggas Sayin` My Name In They Bullshit
It`s Like Putting A Knife Against The Lyrical Full-Clip
Do Shit On My Own, I Never Asked For Help
If I Was Rapping Like Y`all I Woulda Killed Myself
And Naw This Ain`t Beef, It`s Missing A Few Ingredients
Dog You Ain`t General, Stick To Being Obedient
Piggy Back, That Ain`t Something I Had To Do
Laughing At Drake ? You Shoulda Seen How I Was Laughing At You
I Don`t Beef Over Little Shit, Angry ? A Little Bit
Little Niggas Get Little Recognition You Little Bitch
I Don`t Do The Little Subliminals, I`m Addressin` It
Littles Wanna Get In The Middle Then I`m Suggesting It
They Called You A Bitch, Were Trynna Act Out
They Challenge Him To A Fight And Then They Back Out
So Tell Me How The Fuck I Can Respect You Cats
If You A Gangsta, Then What Part Of The Game Is That ?
[Verse: Drake]
Hey Yo Aristo I`m Lost
Can You Tell Me Whats Going On In The Streets
How It Feel To Count Dough
While You Palmin` The Heat
And Yes I Asked For A 16
You Did Your 16
I Heard That Weak Shit And Only Wanted The Beats (It`s True)
But Fuck The Money And The Cars That I Drive To Set
And Fuck The Women Thats Lying To All The Guys They Met (Fuck All Of That)
And Fuck The Features On My Songs
And The Deals On The Table
Or Basically Just Fuck Everything That You Strive To Get
And It`s The Room Of Resolution
I`m Finishing It In Here
If I Copy Budden`s Flow, You Mimicing His Career
And The Same Money We Hearing You Giving To Charity
You Need To Be Giving To Littles To Give Him Some Clarity (What Up Littles)
Cuz Thats Your Homeboy I Think He`s Owed That Much
Tell Him Pressing 25 Don`t Mean You Sold That Much
And Breana, I Don`t Mean To Alarm Ya
But You Need To Get Outside The Car
To Shoot This Video In Parma (Tony!)
You Act Like You Hood And Hood Niggas`ll Harm Ya
And This Is Not Hating My Nigga We Call It Karma
But Yo Thuglife, Show Me Where That Hammer Be
Yes I Took A El On My Own And They Didn`t Damage Me
You Try To Cover Up Your Lies Like A Canopy
And Try To Pull 17 Year Olds Down In Bramalea (I Know About It)
And We Don`t Got It Out For You
We Just Saying That Don`t Nobody Vouch For You
Nope, Nobody Thorough Is Willing To Give A Cosign (Nobody)
And You Don`t Even Sell Blow, You Just Blow Time
You Can`t Even Get A Factor Grant
So Stop Rapping, Go Fix Parts At A Tractor Plant (Damn)
And Listen Here Tetely T
You One Of The Seven Dwarfs Standing Next To Me
You Probably Snitching In Court, Then Accept The Plea
And I Hear You Paying These Women And I Sex For Free (What Up Sweetheart)
But Dog, How Did This Start
How We Get To This Part
We All Got Niggas Doing Bids Mr. Wishheart (What Up Cam)
It`s Not Cool To Use Another Nigga`s As A Threat Tho`
I Said You A Bitch, I Heard A Seven Man Echo
You Saying I Hustle, My Source For Currency Coke
They Saying You Never Moving It And Currently Broke
And You Risk Doing Crack Time And Hang Around Black Crime
Just So You Can Have Something To Say In You Rap Lines
They Say Drake Killed It Like Young Girls At A Private School (I Did)
Dog If I Were You, I Tell You What I Would Do
I Would Cut Ties With The Cops And Just Make Them Fire You
Lose The Body Pack And The Velcro You Feed The Wire Through
Tell Them Not To Call And That`s Even If They Require You
Cuz They The Only People Recording That Wanna Hire You (It`s True)
With What I Spend In A Weekend I Could Aquire You
Some Of Them Believe You Got Money You Little Liar You
But, I Don`t Admire You Short Niggas Tell Tall Tales
Good Riddance Aristo I Just Retired You!
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART>  <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, yeah

But you don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard you never claimed the hood
Hear the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big that they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin'
Yeah, Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lot of sides on the same side
OVO we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold in no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy, whole city goin' crazy
Top 5 no debating
Top 5, top 5, top 5
And the whole city rave me
And I'm back inside a matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no metal-on-the-way shit
We done really put some days in
Hey why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? God damn
You acting like you fucking won a trophy and shit
This nigga turnt the fuck up
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin out, they can't stand me

I'm err off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features or ad-libs
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me

I won't go
Yeah
I would not go

You gotta know
Vital, oh baby, don't bite though
Remember what I left when I go
Remember what I said when I'm stoned
That's right
[Chorus]
Please don't stand at my grave and cry, no
I'm not there, they made it so I can never really die, no
Please don't stand at my grave and cry, no
Pop champagne, scream my words
Let me leave on a high note
And don't let nobody call me an idol
'Cause I was never sitting, I go
And Auckland, they go where I go
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Uh, I am a distraction,
Comin' from my spot and I dont signal as I back in.
If cash is beautiful and money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin' centerfold to Maxim.
Open to my page and admire my desire,
Frequent flyer I aspire to retire,
My voice stands alone even if I'm with the choir,
Got a cannon on my hip but nigga this is not Mariah.
Nah, this the record killer for hire.
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require,
Look what I created despite the niggas that hated,
Every single bar gettin first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin so sedated.
The me and bitch the same we feeling so related,
Forest Hill estated or Dennis Caded
I put a thousand on it, I could prolly fuck the waitress.
So wait just take this,
One line at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, nigga haha
Yeah, I wrote this verse sittin in my new car,
Sometimes where you headed is too far,
It's more about where you are.
And I am everywhere that you wish you could be
Somebody somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up,
I'm at the label in the elevator,
Send them up

Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax

Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note

Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I gotta do mansion 'cause I outgrew condo
Got a new Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I'm never washed, but I'm not new

And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

 <SONGSTART> She says kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?
I get off topic don't I? I get it poppin' don't I?
I'll end up stopping won't I? And by the time I end up stopping
You'll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don't lie
She's losing it right now, cause if I wasn't who I am
she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now
I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she's here and we're both so gone
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend -- she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes
don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit
I put you back in yo place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now
I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she's here and we're both so gone
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stop fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night, because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long
I'm floatin' in and out on consciousness
And they say that I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time wit all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't wanna problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it
Please don't do it
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money
So Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just somethin' they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know
Yeah, that the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's somethin' they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah
I be yellin' out
Money over everything
Money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they missed the old Drake
Girl, don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is... overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like, why I gotta be all that?
But still I can't deny the fact that it's... true
Listen to you expressin' all them feelin's
Soap opera rappers
All these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's how you thinkin' is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this
It isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I don't even gotta say it
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know
Yeah, that the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's somethin' they know
They know, they know, they know
I be yellin' out
Money over everything
Money on my mind (mind mind mind)
Tell 'em I apologize
It happened over time (time time time)
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
What are we even doing?
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "you don't how good it is to be you cause you're him"
And I say "well, goddamn"
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
All of this, it's alcohol, it's drugs, weed, it's everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need uh, uh, uh, uh to educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot
(Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted...)
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the Heat Of The Moment. It's the Heat Of The Moment and that's all it is. It's The Heat Of The Moment
(I agree.)
This shit, that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment. Be a 100% woman, or try and be a 100% man, and use a fucking condom
(Haaa.)

Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian I still went to church that year, guess
I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
You ain't really f****d with me way back then but
Ya, you ain't really f**k with me way back then girl, how bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how bout now?
Girl how bout now? How bout now girl?
What about now girl? How bout now?

 <SONGSTART> 
So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
Aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
When you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more,
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly,
So many lonely sleepless nights,
Im going through hell to convince you love me,
But never her approval no matter how I try,
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
Momma always told me to respect the woman,
But what am I to do when her parents do not try,
So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say,
Oooooohhh
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
I've been so dependent on your love for so long,
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now its changed,
My life aint the same as you are,
Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,
If I can't have what mean most to me,
So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say,
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself

 <SONGSTART> Gotta do what I gotta do
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where,
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

Hell yeah, hell yeah

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

 <SONGSTART> Why you live off of the hype bruh?
Real T-way!
Yeah
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick
I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need some addressing
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they were bidding on me
But I'm young money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasing women a distraction
They want to be on TV right next to me
You cannot be right here next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They gonna die out eventually
I could not give you the recipe
You know the game is so separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
VIEWS already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
A gram, two poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer i'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they weren't hearing it
They feeling the way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They got to go, they got to go
They gotta doubt eventually
I cannot give them no empathy
I'mma have [?] when I'm at 70
They cannot fuck with my legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this there's no one to threaten me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life

Everybody said that you let me down
Hesitation bring the "you" around
Makes no difference what you used to do
[Chorus]
I can never be ashamed of you
I could never
I could never

Maybe you were reckless yesterday
I'm convinced you know a better way, I know it
Some would judge based on what you've been through but
[Chorus]
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I, I could never (yeah, yeah)
[Verse 3]
You've told me things
Harsh truth to my face like
Been told to walk away (just know)
I could never
Things that I would choose to do with you if I had time though
Thousand times I fucked you in my mind, trust me I know
[Verse 4: Jorja Smith]
Everybody said that I let you down
And let the truth but I can still be found, yeah
Lost my way and only you were there
[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Could you ever, yeah
Could you ever
[Verse 5: Jorja Smith]
Sometimes I ask how you could ever want me
How could you choose that you would ever love me
Yours were the truest eyes I'd ever seen
To be in a stare right back at me
[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah

I get money*
I get paper,
I get girls on different flavors,
I buy gucci, I buy prada,
I spend dolla after dolla (2x)
[Drake:]
Y'all don't really like me,
I can understand,
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants,
I still fly, you can't float,
Run this sh-t, Usain Bolt,
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost,
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote,
I'm getting rich while you stayin broke,
Chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat,
I can't see you through a Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch when you throw me high fives,
They try to measure up but there is no one my size,
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes,
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off,
Every single thing a n-gga purchase is a write off,
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off,
Baby go ahead and cut the light off,
[Repeat Chorus:]
[Kevin Cossom:]
I'm the rookie of the year (year)
About to get my dough on,
I'm about to take off, baby you should hold on,
But I ain't about to prolong,
I'm a keep it short and tell you what's about to go on,
Bottle after bottle cause the money like so long,
Baby... we about to put a show on,
I'm a show off, like I'm supposed to,
Yeah you can get lost, I don't know you,
[Drake:]
I hear my phone ringing when you call,
I ain't picking up an' entertaining them at all,
Got your girl face down banging on the wall,
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmmm,
I cannot relate,
Riding with some tags that I got from outta state,
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space,
Just show me who's the hottest I'm a knock em outta place,
Call me homicide drizzy about to kill your ego,
I'm about my green puffing guddi like I'm Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero,
While a Houston stripper pole dance in a zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me,
And my g-pass is as valid as can be,
I'm, I'm so fresh the stylist would agree,
Waving at your girl while she smiling back at me
[Repeat Chorus:]
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
Shit nigger
This what I does
I swear I ain't lying
Like this is my cubs

And I'm dirty then a suma bitch
Weezy f baby
Always looking like I does some shit
You ain't known nothing bitch
Better knbow who you fucking with
Try to fuck me

No homo tee I had to go stupid
I'm on them high heels
And I am no bootsie
Collins avenue riding with the phatom roof gone
Or the maybach two tone and my rims are to grown
That mean they 24's boy, what are you on?
I'm richer then a bitch without the grey pupon
Yea, I'm talkin out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a blood muthafucka a blood muthafucka
Forever like E-T-C peri-od muthafucka
It may not mean nothin to ya'll
But understand nothin was done for me
So I don't plan of stoppin at all

I'm shuttin shit down in the mall
And tell every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin to call
I want this shit forever mayne
Look I tell her
I'm so unsigged, it would blow ones mind
Cause to every single record I am so unkind
There are no holds barred there is no love lost
Nigga this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P-A-Y-U-P, I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me
Neva L-I-E, I got everything I tell them I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin a yacht
Ya heard me
Who else tryna smoke? yea nigga me too
Cause take my mind off the presure is what weed do
Ya girl wetter then the bottom of a ski-doo
And take a bitch from any nigga it's what we do
So bite down hoe and get the right dentist
I told wayne I'm goin in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots of who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that: 10-4
It may not mean nothin to ya'll
But understand nothin was done for me
So I don't plan of stoppin at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin shit down in the mall
And tell every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin to call
I want this shit forever mayne
Put on my O-J gloves and go kill this shit
Make a plummer throw his plunger like "I can't deal with this shit"
The sound throwed off I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formed, well I don't slack on shit
Bitch I'm back on my shit like a fly
Since you wan' be fly throw you off the roof, fly
Like pookie, take a dookie on the rapper loose leaf throw
Andthrow trash bag through the window lookie
To a shark you just sushi
You ain't hard ya coohie walle oochie
Soft as newborn booty
Uhn said I'm movin slow I'm just thinkin fast
Look back I ain't behind ya, I'm bout to lap ya ass
And nigga I don't rest, I'm up until my times up
I been a tec' chef for all my beef prime cut
This ain't punch lines, nigga ya punch is lime (lame)
Cause the only punch you ever gave was Hawaiian
It may not mean nothin to ya'll
But understand nothin was done for me
So I don't plan of stoppin at all
I want this shit forever mayne

So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayne
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayne
Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know g4 pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I bald, Kimo
Dropped a mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country-wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayne
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayne
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues for me
Old money Benjamin Button, what? I nutting
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and goddamn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayne
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayne
Okay, hello, it's da Martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is like a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil' Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayne
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayne
There they go, back in stadiums as shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Boso's
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck, no go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about
When we riot
You dealing with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings, till our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at
Me so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass
So loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place
So play some Drake
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Hello mothafucka, hey hi how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
First off
You know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out
Cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business
So button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though: I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and bucking when the hook drop
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
Hold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan
I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club
Then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands
And I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room
Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all"
I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs"
I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in
Where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this life end
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in! 
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
Bitch, 
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard

 <SONGSTART> [Intro - Drake]
I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
I said I'm on one
[Verse 1 - Drake]
I'm getting so cold
I ain't went this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easily?
But get it while you here boy
Because all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah, and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you because you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!
[Chorus - Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody should of told you
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
Because I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on one
[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the Red Bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facing eight
Still running with the same niggas till the death of me
Ever seen a million cash? Got to count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams?
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair
And it's Double M G until I get the chair
[Chorus - Drake]
[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the FEDS listening, nigga what money?
I'm a made nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishers
I'm focused might as well say cheese for the pictures
Oh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches, mazel tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killing these hoes, I swear I'm trying stop the violence
[Chorus]

Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
I dropped a few whoopty whoops in my cup
Put it on my tab put her on my tab
Franchise tag on me Bron Bron
Steph Curry wrists nigga Oakland
Percies for the bitches Bishop magic Don Juan
Standing ovation and an encore
And I keep the check Nike concord
Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me
Got a gang of broads riding with me, on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Whole time I was ready
They was like "hold up wait a minute" I was like "nah nigga let's get it"
This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already
If you come here trying to take some there's a lot more where that came from
And it really ain't no thing, I got Summer P in this thing
I just drop the jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
Ya, ya up and away
Y'all should have seen this shit coming in May
We doing 300 records a day
Who really think they can get in the way
Nah, nah, niggas is bitter they hurting
Look at the business mergers
Throwed back when I'm swerving
Big body my Suburban
Everything I do on purpose
I'm blowing up like I'm urgent
And she was acting like a virgin
I gave it to her then I curved her
Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug

 <SONGSTART> Yeah
I'm workin' on dyin'
I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way
What you expect?
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month, I'm supposed to pay her bills
And get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991
Outta time, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool
I'm upset
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (ayy, ayy)
Every month, she don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front
She gon' tryna settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?
I'm upset
Half a million on my head I can't accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a tech (skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked
Hate me, never met me in a flesh
Said she's got somethin's she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep trynna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, I appreciate ya patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find now-a-days it's just best to keep quiet
But uh, sometimes you jus gotta let it out
Young angel and young lion
You know what it is, uh
Look, I'm the property of october
I ain't drive here I got chauferred
Bring me champagne flutes,
Rose and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma
I'm a stockholder,
Private flights back home no stop over
Still spittin that shit that they shot pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two excedrin
I'm the one twice over I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin, I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein me all hard
And lyin to they girls and drivin the same cars
Sittin there wishin they problems became ours
Cause we have nothin in common
Since I done became star
I done became bigger swervin writin in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holla my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
An show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby word to chuck inglish
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers
My song is ya girlfriend's wakin up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figga
How to get these label heads to offer 'em good figures
And me doin them shows gettin everyone nervous cause
Them hipsters gon have to get alone with them hood niggas
It's all good I'm goin off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta rent a movie called hoes over
Rest in peace to heath ledger but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on ya table nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy no toaster
G and tez got a cig but I'm no smoker
They jus handin chips to me nigga no poker
I'm with it, young money, cash money soldier
My cup runneth over,
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 chris paul shit
D.r., c.j, an po' I see y'all
These cases don't workout I hope we can agree on
Makin enough to pay any judge judy off
First thing I'm a do is free weezy, go
And I take probation
I don't want that t.I. and vick vacation
Private plane, big location
Goin to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young roy
Jones junior fightin the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me un-guarded
And I'm a cheese head word to vince lombardi
Word to marky mark leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recordin
I ain't recordin I'm jus C-4'in
My currency foreign
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in ya pocket an pay homage
Better cover ya eyes ya face fallin
Watch the game from the side I'm play callin
No I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I, damn sure don't tarnish
My piss don't got comments for ya garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-y no homo I'm on it
Weezy f baby new born bitch
You know what they say bout when ya palm itch

Young money in ya tummy and we gon shit

It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though: I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and bucking when the drop
Hold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room, Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all", I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this night ends
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in!
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I'm so fuckin dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There's a diamond on my dick so there's a diamond on her tongue
I can't feel you baby cause I romantically numb
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come
There's nothing under God's sun that I haven't done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn't one
Girls are like buses every 15 min they run
Now they like potato chips I just can't have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don't like your friends in my business
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don't believe you
Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it
Pow, Pow, fuck is up, now man I'm in this ho
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me
Wondering if I'm the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck you, niggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don't believe you
Ain't that your girl
Ain't that your money
Ain't you the same nigga that say she want you that you funny
Ain't you a gangsta, yeah funny
You gave em funny, gave you to you, fucking dummy
Classic line, bitches run like buses
Gucci say niggas asking why, why you with my girl
She let me get it nigga
She ain't stupid, go turn up your radio
I'm the next young Lionel Richie
I gives a fuck about doing a fucking cameo
We don' love em, we don' love em, we don' love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them O's
Cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
Thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don't go
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl

Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody

cause this baby is free,
and she lets nobody else in except for me!
if her basement is locked, then i swear she would agree
i'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key
chorus: (x2)
bright light, city lights downtown every night,
never has to think twice,
only does what she likes,
what she wants, what she needs,
she's my independent queen!
what she wants, what she needs,
she's my independent queen!
don't forget that fendi purse that you put all your cash in,
kinda' hard to concentrate when the cameras are flashing.
all the dudes suffocate her, i don't wanna grasp in,
don't know where she's going, and i do not plan on asking at all!
i've never been the type to.. my connection
with nigger that wanna fight over women, that's not right,
there's too many in the world, homie you could
but i swear that was my girl, i swear it was my girl!
chorus: (x2)
bright light, city lights downtown every night,
never has to think twice,
only does what she likes,
what she wants, what she needs,

what she wants, what she needs,
she's my independent queen!
yeah, she works hard, but she plays even harder,
all-star weekend and she's been voted my favorite starter.
on the back of a jersey, so you won't forget it,
but she shines bright, blind them light
so that.. forget it.
just one life to live, the kind of life i will
and if i don't see her tonight, the rest of my life i will regret it!
she's not perfect, but she's just perfect to me,
like it's a highway, let's ride it, you know in a second with me1
chorus: (x2)
bright light, city lights downtown every night,
never has to think twice,
only does what she likes,
what she wants, what she needs,

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
Soâyouâbetter take yourâtime with me
'Cause I remember lastâtime you wouldn't make love to me
Think you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me now
Say, say I'm so crazy, baby
I wanted you to race my mind
I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to erase my mind
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom.
After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm... what chu got?
Comeback.
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is, "Where the rest of my commas?"
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The Boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, "How Does It Feel?"
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got? Time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (my heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (tempt me)
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly (highly)
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for you
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Emotions in this game run deep,
so before they say this to me in my sleep,
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure,
repping to my last second dude,
done a lot of sh-t they never get to do,
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure,
Honored to be somebody they mention,
but before these n-ggas stop paying attention...
I just say it's been a pleasure,
You'll never be somebody they need
tomorrow aint guaranteed so tonight we gon do it like this,
Like ohhhh...
For the A-Town, tonight I'm going to let somebody go
For the A-Town
Uhh, set up the occasion,
I'm up in the place in,
if amazing was a young b-tch,
I be going to jail cuz I be f-cking amazing,
whats up in the taking,
I'm ready and Im willing, why the f-ck are we waiting,
yeah, and baby you should bring your best friend,
then you should persuade her to let me get some sex in,
don't get offended baby thats just a suggestion,
really we can do it like however you like,
I'm probably in your hotel tonight,
whatever floor that me and 40 staying on is smelling riiight,
yeah, just know we grinding til it's light out,
show up in your city turn that muthaf-cker right out,
yeah, tell me who controls kings,
I don't follow rules, stupid old things,
I'm riding through the city in the coupe with those wings,
my team deserves some muthaf-cking superbowl rings,
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
oh yeah, and I know we gon get it,
me and Jeezy bout it shorty holla if you wit it,
even though I want it to this sh-t don't last forever,
but better late than never, honestly I'd like to say its been a pleasure,
Like ohhhh...

For the A-Town

That I didnt know last year, who the fuck are yall?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere, back
But I just cant remember it all
(Chorus)
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, thats right, Im doin me

Im livin life right now, mayne
And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over
But its far from over
(Verse 1)
Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are yall thinkin?
Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldnt've drove, tell me how Im gettin home
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I needs a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them? Well, fuck it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, Ill make him a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it, throwin hundreds
When I should be throwin ones, bitch, I run it Ahhhh!
(Bridge)
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the fuck are yall?

Oh, yeah, thats right, Im doin me

And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over
But its far from over
(Verse 2)
One thing bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, its just game
Its just what comes with the fame, and Im ready for that, Im just sayin
But I really cant complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Vizsine on
Yall just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Ima quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it, who you kiddin, man?
nobodys never done it like I did it Ahh!
(Bridge)
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year, who the fuck are yall?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere, back
But I just cant remember it all
(Chorus)
What am I doin? What am I doin?
Oh, yeah, thats right, Im doin me

 <SONGSTART> R.I.P. to the girl you used to see.
Her days are over. Baby she's over.
I've decided to give you all of me.
Baby come closer, baby come closer.
I'm ready for ya!
Kill 'em all, switch it up.
Put it on, zip it up.
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater.
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better.
No option for her, you sayin' no.
I run this game, just play your role.
Follow my lead, what you waitin' fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night.
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I'm in control, but with you bein' the man,
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
So keep thinkin' you the man,
'Cause it's all part of my plan.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
Nothin' on, I strut around.
I do it big, I shut it down.
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me.
Mental picture, no cameras please.
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I'm in control, but with you bein' the man,
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
So keep thinkin' you the man,
'Cause it's all part of my plan.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind,
Flash, black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast,
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you want it fast... define fast
'Cause I can speed it up, and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past,
And make damn sure you never forget it
Committed
I'm ready, I'm with it... still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos,
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed too
Plus I got a sex pistol, pointed right at you "BANG!"
The baddest women ever and the hardest out,
Proven over and over again that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'till the death, I took the carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I'm in control, but with you bein' the man,
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
So keep thinkin' you the man,
'Cause it's all part of my plan.
I-I-I'm ready for ya.
R.I.P to the girl

You have potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (ooh, yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', differences in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (jaded)

26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
On all of my old shit, oh shit
I devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they're winning
On some coach shit, 50Ms for a three month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'mma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
But that's that's where all this. that's where the feeling is.
That's where all that shit comes from man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh. was just.
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all.
We went through errythang.
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD
Your money is just a little Barney's Co Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best emcee
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I comedy central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain't got no condoms)
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back
Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Feel naked cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you niggas is autistic, retarded
Started, hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for twelve hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less to me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout taking my lane
They ain't even got on my road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here telling everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up

Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout taking my lane
They ain't even got on my road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here telling everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know, I know

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Yeh, ah... ah
Boy wonder... Drizzy
Ah... ah... Uh
Ya'll ain't really like me
I can understand
Ma flow is sitting right inside da pocket on ma pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, you sink boat
A write your favorite records, you sing ghost
20 thousand for a verse, is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, aah, you staying broke
Chilling if even if am in a goosed down coke
I can't' see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't' even flinch if you thorw me hi fives
They try to measure up, but there's no my size
Whatever 40 smokin bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, a never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the lights off
Cause It's about to go...
[beat plays]
I hear ma phone ringing when they call
A ain't picking up or entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down and banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys, hatin and remain small
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmmmmm
I cannot relate
Riding with some tags that a got from out-a-state
Riding with a swag that a got from out-a-space
Just show me who's the hottest I'm a knock him out his place
Call me homeside drizzy, about to kill your ego
I'm about ma green, puffin goody like I'm celo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantacy to you, reality to me
And yeh ma g-pass is as valid as can be
I'm, I'm so fresh, a stylist with degree
Waving at your girl
While she's smiling back at me like...
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> 
Yeah,
Uh, This verse start's as my sniper hits they mark
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let em all go
And most woman are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stairs
Couple text
Couple dates
Couple I think that we're readys
Couple I think that we should we waits
Are we acting like a couple
I'm just trying to get it straight
Cuz I'm over convinced cuz it's too early for mistakes
Ohhhh, you had to change up the game
Ohhh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days
Can't stand the rain in July
Oh July
Let the fireworks explode
Exploding
Now it's getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why?
It's just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh Baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
Drake's Verse
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night
Everynight was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I'm confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who kills chivalry
They need to get they sentence in
Meanwhile we arguing and I can't get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end
Ohhhh, you had to change up the game
Ohhh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days
Can't stand the rain in July
Oh July
Let the fireworks explode
Exploding
Now it's getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why?
It's just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh Baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
See, it's funny cuz
I never thought this would end
But then the season changed
You are my, You are my, You are my love
Should remain, Should remain, you are my love
I surely did everything to make you happy baby,
Oh yeah
Can't wait for, Can't wait for, Can't wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly,
I will spread my wings and Fly......
And I'm too fly for this shit
Ohhhha wooooh...

Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do
These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do
She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the Jungle, she from the Jungle
I take somebody elses car, drive it undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do
These days these new girls got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done doing everything we do
Who is your replacement?

 <SONGSTART>  <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet now were meeting our ends
And its all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on
And its all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the wave
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer
Anytime people want to start problems
For real are you done
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no catty
And I'm not afraid of no waste neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Its that fact

 <SONGSTART> [LUPE FIASCO: TALKING]
Uh, what up y'all!
Soundtrack what's popping baby?
Y'all ain't know, I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that first and fifteen
Jyea, uh!
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying?
Legally and illegally
Hahaha...
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out
[VERSE 1: LUPE FIASCO]
First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip
And bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like THISSSSS
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
Yea, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling
Something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, just the first kickflip he land it
Uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk!
His neighbors couldn't stand it so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Yea, when they said, "It's getting late in here...
... so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"
[CHORUS]
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast
[VERSE 2: DRAKE]
(Waddup Lupe, Chi Town! )
My style is very Tennessee
Mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barley remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
But check it gets boring growing up in memphis
Trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board it gets expensive
Luckly my aunt working as a nurse
So every time I needed something she just reach up in her purse
And plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm staying in her house then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She say you need to be doing something other than skating
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
I ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
So now it's me and old school
Chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Open up the window told me that the coast clear
Now I coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
Homie this is Recess east test
Life's ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes I'm literly Landel Lewis with a kick and a snare
Kick flip in the air
The kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here
Breathe again think it's obvious that they need my soul
Cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
I say aunty this is a safe career
She said Drake I told you there's no skating here
[CHORUS:]
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast
[VERSE 3: LUPE FIASCO]
Before he knew he had a crew
That wasn't no punk
And they spitfire shirts
And SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
Any escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy
They needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds
The world was theirs
Uh, and their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"
[CHORUS:]
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast

I don't claim colors
Honestly, the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter
But when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi Coast
Couple days on the beach
Then its adiios
(Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You would swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees, no honeycomb
And you could probably feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs

Before rap,
My last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success
It look like right now
What was once gray skies
Is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones y'all said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps
And you see what I'm bout
I keep my money comin' in
And never goin' out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over-shine
Been fuck bitches

Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc,
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox (locks).
Now let's go.
Take 'em back to the plan...
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
Let's take 'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line,
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend.
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.

They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
[Drake]
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go LA, VA
NY, TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at amazing'
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
[Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude

[Lupe Fiasco]
guess who's on third?
Lupe still like Lupin the Third.
Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterwerf
But, before you say another word,
I'm back on the block like I'm layin on the street.
I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra,
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.
Engarde, Touch Lupe cool as the Unthawed,
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.
I come as correct as a porn star,
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.

 <SONGSTART> Whoa, whoa
Yeah
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry
But I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when
They say they doin' all this and all that?
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib
But sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs at this party
I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty come sit on my lap, ayy
They sayin' Drizzy just snapped
This in between us is not like a store
This isn't an closeable gap, ayy
I see some niggas attack
And don't end up makin' it back
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry
But I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at
When they say they doin' all this and all that?
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club?
'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tay is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer
But you only one from the neck
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper
You play with me you will get stretched, ooh-oh
Ran dracs in the hood, surround Drake around dracs
Even though I got a case
I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry
But I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at
When they say they doin' all this and all that?
When he tell the story, that's not how it ain't how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out of Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent
Valet just call me to tell come get it
I knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they want dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back, she said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe in
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry
But I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby

Oh my God, oh my God

Got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas

Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish
Make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'ont know who we are
Fuck em all, they only pussy niggas shootin at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong
When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back

 <SONGSTART> Uh, when did you get like this
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, this just ain't my style
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile, for me
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Leave me, leave me, I can't fuckin stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end
But, I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call
You jus tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that... do that... do that
Yeah
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I've been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go
Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

Hands are tied
Someone's in my ear from the other side
Tellin' me that I should pay you no mind
Wanted you to not be with me all night
Wanted you to not stay with me all night
I know, you know, who that person is to me
Doesn't really change things
[Chorus]
I know you're scared of dating, falling for me
Shorty, surely you know me
Right here for you always
You know, I don't ever change
Right here for you always
You know I don't ever change
Right here for you
[Bridge]
In mind you make me want to do things, love you
Like I'm supposed to
You make me want to love you
Like I'm supposed to
You make me want to love you
Like I'm supposed to, remind you
Ayy
[Chorus]
I know you're scared of dating, falling for me
Shorty, by now you know me
Right here for you always
You know, I don't ever change
Right here for you always
You know I don't ever change
Right here for you

 <SONGSTART> Hands down
I'm too proud, for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking of
But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me
Cause you don't know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh oho
But your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh oho
But maybe in time, in time, in time
I'll tell you
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you
Oh oho
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I they know I ah ah ah
I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
Cause your know baby I love you love you
A little bit
I would do it
You'd say it
You'd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha hm
I think I'm a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit
Little bit
In lalalala love with me
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You can teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronon
Both n'sync like a justin song
Feels so right but it's just soo wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
Where niggas said I know, tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well tell her fall back caught up in some more shit tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know yeah tell her all that, that
And as for you I think I know your the one
The closest I've come
I'm probably...
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
Oh oho
Lalalala love
Oh oho, oh oho

Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears did on my last bitch
The money made me hungry I'm a savage
I've seen stars lining up you can't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ha
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ha
Cuban links hanging on my wrist I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look around see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked outside Buford County came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean I ain't even started drinking beer yet
The pussy I trap out I need that
Came out clean, I ain't clean my shit still there
Just imagine you was living lavish and they still there
Walk up in the crib look pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that will keep it real yeah
Got a lot of pretty bitches I just paid their bills now
Money make me feel good but does she make me feel good
Known for gettin' that guala out in europe while we're still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a motherfucker like I'm on my last damn dollar
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch
I ain't talking about some real money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money bitch
Reporting live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker
It's not even a discussion (whoop)
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gon' end up dipping with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her tripping off of yay, yay
Pillow talking dishing out on all y'all
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what's coming
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as that night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs who go Karrueche with the chopsticks
And we gon miss you
They don't wanna smoke they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through

And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to all my asian girls Dim sum
Shots came I don't know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes I'm bout to take ya hem from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Yeah, are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don't I got that shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me... paint drying
I don't never be trippin off of what ain't mine
I be hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing ain notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
And the kids wearing crowns over here and everything is alright
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you 'cause those are deadly
And then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"
And I leave out and you call me, tell me that your sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see, it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked as hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we're probably gonna end up robbing a bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
I almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son and that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You know that I was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
It's like '06 in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real, it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now -- he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
That still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, to you got to me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid goin' through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounce but we bounce back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out man
You deserve it
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
That still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, to you got to me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid goin' through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounce but we bounce back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out man
You deserve it
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You know that I was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> All we wanted was opportunity
Just Blaze, Lord Knows!
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Hefner and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing
I'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real
Places they say they've been, we've actually going for real
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping
I'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roll this and boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real
You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink
The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R
Headlights flickin', lookin' like a fallin' star
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake, I'm gettin' cake, nothin' short of great
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I don't care what society thinks.
They're nothing anyway.
They're no better than me.
Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you.
Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals.
You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)
No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

 <SONGSTART> [Dennis Graham:]
Hey, Instagram
This song I've been writing, oh, for a few months
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)
[Drake:]
Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
[Drake (Dennis Graham):]
You got some liquor at the house?
(Yeah)
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
(I don't see it)
(Okay, hahaha)
[Drake:]
Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
[Drake & Dennis Graham:]
Yes, sir
(Baby)
Hold on, hold on
(Let me tell you something about me)
(I really do know, I know who I wanna be)
Woo
Lord, I already passed on all that (Woo)
You go 'head on, haha

 <SONGSTART> Damn, another 20 missed calls. I love her and i hate her it's a funny twist ya'll. Can't stand her when she in town but miss her when shes gone. Truth be told i'd rather be with her then alone. But fights break out, and nieghbors call 5-0. Screaming you the most foul bitch i know. Forever mine, wherever i go sex pistols out, die slow. Nah, die slower then that just, colapse all over my matress. Who shot ya, that nigga ain't finished. So once again i find myself in it. Click Clack. Just let me take a minute round 2 is in the chamber all you gotta do is spin it. Aim for the heart, battle of the sexes, alls fair in love and war casualties expected.
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART>  <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
Aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
When you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more,
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly,
So many lonely sleepless nights,
Im going through hell to convince you love me,
But never her approval no matter how I try,
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
Im ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
Momma always told me to respect the woman,
But what am I to do when her parents do not try,
So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing Im afraid to say,
Oooooohhh
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
Ive been so dependent on your love for so long,
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now its changed,
Dirty Money Loving You No More lyrics found on
My life aint the same as you are,
Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,
If I cant have what mean most to me,
So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing Im afraid to say,
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause Ive drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And theres pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear thats sittin in the dryer
How come every time that youre suspicious Im a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And thats the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what Im gone do
Since everything Im trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one Im missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then well be for sure
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Im tryin do it all tonight
I got plans
I got a certain lust for life
And as it stands
Everything is going as right
As it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight
Before it lands
Before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish ya'll will fall back
But gettin rich suppose to slove that
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say
No no no
My ex send late night text cause she dont know how to let
Go go go
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold oh yea they with
us
Let them girls in for a drink
And Im all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Everytime that Im here but when am I really even here?
Black surburban wit the tent on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But ima be the one to pour cement on it
And start over
And show up in an Mars yellow tux
I dont really give a fuck
And we only getting older
So what i tend to do is to think of today as the past
Its funny when u coming in first but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last
that it last
that it last
that it last
that it last
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Low-key Peter Parker flow
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though
Private flights no hassle I just park and go
I'm the highlight like when markers glow
Oooooh, look what you created
Only got yourself to blame
I remember when you hated ooooh
Now you tell me take my time
How bout I just take your city make that muthaf-cker mine uh ha
I'm a underground king ho
I sit tall, I swang low
The game ain't always fair and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don't get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain't never answering
You ain't figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can't come in
Call me Ron Bergundy ya'll the other anchormen
Whats on the news trick, gossiping bout music
Cause rumours I'm the new shit
And guess what it's true bitch
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
Its so amazing
You woulda thought we made it up
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine
Ay look
I need less friends more bread
Less talk more head
Used to ride escorts now I get escorted (do it)
I'm just waiting on my cue dog no pledge
Said she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed
Threw on my track team handed my baton to her
Passed her blew her off, I chronic Veronica
Who got up on my nerves so I had to platonic her
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica
I'm the head of my estate ain't that ironic huh
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer
Ohh, I'm who they going ape shit over
I'm who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over
See broads over niggas but business over broads
See business equals money and money's over all
I'm tryna move my momma from the ghettos to the meadows
Well she can't stay in that fucking hood forever, forever
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit baggage check and a chick
Fast girls, faster whip, big chains master shit
Bitch I'm living everyday month yearly
Yell until you muthfuckers hear me
We made it
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it

made men, I'm screaming dollar bills
park the trunk on the Porsche
there they go, Dollar bills
Black panorama, I call it T-Pain
I got my autotune, that bitch insane
got my revolver too, I call it Ving Rhames
you still a baby boy, we doing big things
street n-ggas, you hear what I said
I got some bad news, Jabar back in the feds
facing twenty, he just did a dime
been out a year, look like he finna ride
genocide, these people killing time
throw you in a hole, you must be penalised
soon as you see success, haters reinvest
miami gardens drive, half a million nothing less
raised the bar, I set the standards
my yayo Mc Hammer, that bitch just keep on dancing
Michael Jackson, let it moonwalk
set it on the napkin, let it cool off
Dollar bills on top of dollar bills
thats all I'm throwing, if she wont her momma will
made n-ggas, talking a lot of skrill
8 digits a n-gga tryna live
Made man, you hear what I said
I got a hundred squares
if you scared, called the feds
made men, I'm screaming dollar bills
park the trunk on the Porsche
there they go, Dollar bills

 <SONGSTART> I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
God knows it
Your mind impure, soul I possess, he knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn they back
On they best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
People change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn they back
On they best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
You put food on the table for me, aye?
Alright, fam, soft. I see you, aye?
You pay my bills, right?
It's light
You're a wasteman

 <SONGSTART> Breathe through, ride through, damn girl
Oh man I don't know
Pilled up filled up damn girl
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man
Laced up dripped up sauced up
Damn girl I wanna ride with you
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up
Had to get it popping with you
What if I pick you up from your house
We should get out
We haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go
You know that I did
I don't know if you know but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well he'll understand
Pull up I'm pulling up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna I'll say it again
Soon as you get in nah nah nah
Breathe through, ride through, damn girl
Oh man I don't know
Pilled up filled up damn girl
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man
Laced up dripped up sauced up
Damn girl I wanna ride with you
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up
Had to get it popping with you
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you've always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, all I can say is
(I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you...
...B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddling
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

 <SONGSTART> [Verse 1: Drake]
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
Think I had the mothafuckin' plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I'm the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn!
That punch line was predictable
I still got you shittin' bricks, homie, quit the bull
And we don't need new members
To me the clique is full
And I be gettin' the same women that tip the pool
Believe or not
I receive a lot
So, I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buyin' the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be rippin' the same reords that Weezy rock
This shit is easy Pop
That's why I'm ready, man
I'd never copy Norbit like Eddie, man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head?
Did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just tryin' to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playin' streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn't see y'all
These skee-low rappers wishing they could be tall
Lettin' all their fake friends use them like a free stall
Yep!
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain't no nigga like me
Ya dig?
[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chillin'
Super low key
If I'm with the right niggas, you can scoop a O.Z.
All the hustlers and the bouncers
And the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades
In a group with no kids
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cuttin', we can cut some more
Then after you get high, make 'em, get 'em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got alota dough
Plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain't heard?
I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend, even if they been offended
They ain't really got a choice, it's an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it's a given
Plus a nigga famous
Plus I got a vision
Not to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison
They takin' too long
Their records on hold
They threatened by my presence
'Cause I make 'em feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they braggin' 'bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at, 50 thousands goin' gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
'Stead of hatin' on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man
You actin' like a bitch
I ain't actin' like I'm rude
I'm just actin' like I'm rich, rich
Yeah, uh!
Ridin' with Weezy Fuckin' Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fuckin', baby?
'Cause I don't waste time, can't you see a nigga lazy?
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy's fuckin' crazy
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga like a young money nigga
No, ain't no nigga like me
Ya dig?
[Spoken: Lil' Wayne]
Y.M., bitch!
Everybody!
Two time on Sunday!
Spit 'em!
Check ya blinkers, baby!
Check ya blinkers, baby!
'Cause, to me, look like you've been turning right all day! Yeah!
Right my way! Ha ha!
I got a boulevard, baby!
That's right!
Cash Avenue!
Wall Street gangsta!
Carter, y'all! Heh heh!
Why would I lie?
Yeah!
I ain't rich, bitch, I'm wealthy!
Young! I talk shit 'til I die!
Come kill me, nigga!
Fuck you!
No homo!
She like it! Heh ha ha!

Boy, these mothafuckin' glasses I got on right now, are so mothafuckin' cold!
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
I'm feelin' like...
Damn!
I done walked in here
Straight up lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga
Ain't no nigga
Ain't no nigga like a young money nigga

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Here we go
Yeah
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like Billie Jean but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is
one time, and all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothing like the new times
Now it's rough times
I'm out here on front lines just
trying to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breaking my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell them I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry about whose house you live at
Or who loves you more, or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Now, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I got to think for two now, I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that we all now got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some, uh,
RosÃ© and Baccarat out for our cheers to the next generation
But this champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growing so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know, I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
But at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gonna be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hunnid more
Sorry I'm vintage, tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this me and your mother
will have come around instead of always cutting each other down
God willing, I got a good feeling
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this
My G
No one to cry on
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to cry on
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man

Tonight... right now? Did I go out? Yeah, I went out

You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious.
Cups of the RosÃ©, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that I'mma call her anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me
Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that I'mma call you anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, "Well, I'm sorry"
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me
You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that, I hope no one heard that
Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble

And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
Ohhhhhh, she could be good for me
Ohhh, that's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine

She's starin in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away

Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a mothafuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got 'em right?) Yeah I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ's got my credit cards and a lotta ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call the King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin' basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everythin'
And Drake just stands for Do Right and Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl I'm fuckin' serious I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin'
Cause it's on
Yeah girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anythin' you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope you miss me a little when your gone
Ooh shit, mothafucka, goddamn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day: I'm a groundhog
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ugh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin' I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em
Real nigga talkin', shut the fuck up, ho
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zoe?
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for "front door"
Cause that's where I bring it, Soo Woo if you bangin', muthafucka
Yeah girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anythin' you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope you miss me a little when your gone
Uh, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy
H-Town!
(I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, when I'm gone I just hope that you miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me, miss me a little when I'm gone

 <SONGSTART> I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer tryin' to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry about me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire
In this very moment I'm king
In this very moment I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they could think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of
I wish that I could have this moment 4 life

Shout out to the CEO, five hundred degrees
Shout out to the OVO, Red Wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year, we ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
Forty got a bunch of weed he ain't even rolled
These niggas be droppin' songs they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki-Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, "Party of Five"
Are we drinkin' a lil' more I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryin' to make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives
I wish that I could have this moment 4 life

Alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment 4 life

Lil' CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yÃ©
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

 <SONGSTART> More Life.
More time with family and friends. More Life.
I've still got vibrations to send. More Life.
They say that we could live forever
At night I pray it's true
I've done so much in my short time and still there's more to do
But if someone should come collecting
Sooner than we're all expecting
At least the life you lived was one for you
â Drake

 <SONGSTART> Check!
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
mys smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
as for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
alright so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
see life is a scrimmager I am running the iso
what is about to unfold, no tellin' like a dice throw
meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
its only if she's nice though, I ain't about the wife though
and let know, Uncle Ben's rice throw, that is just how my life go
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
and move faster than the leopard sprint
around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
but I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
holla at me baby
Look,

Since you came into college, hill is somethin you still TeVo
then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
or maybe DMP, A Tribe Called Quest
but when you call too much then I call less
you would always complain about my small texts
but what you call conversation I call stress
and that put a barrier between both of our carriers
and I would be like "I ain't getting service in your area"
you be like "n-gga get your bars up"
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
you took out those extensions and lost you a lil weight
your booty lookin bigger and I think that sh-t is great
a fresh start is in order, lemme take you on a date
take you on a date, I used to think you used to play too much
but I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
holla at me baby! (look)

 <SONGSTART> Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like
Fo real
This life shit, is everywhere you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take ya down through there
Make me wanna take ya down through there
I'll take it there
Why you never come to where I stay at?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay at?
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw, man
Me and you are playing house, start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6
And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw man
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I wonder who mothafucking representin' in here tonight
Hold on, hold on
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself?
Care for me, care for me!
I know you care for me!
There for me, there for me! (Louisiana shit)
Said you'd be there for me!
Cry for me, cry for me! (Murda on the beat)
You said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me!
Why won't you live for me?!
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself?
Care for me, care for me!
I know you care for me!
There for me, there for me! (A song for y'all to cut up to, you know?)
Said you'd be there for me!
Cry for me, cry for me! (Yeah)
You said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me!
Why won't you live for me?!
Everybody get your mothafuckin' roll on
I know shorty and she doesn't want no slow song
Had it made last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First, last phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright
It's a short life, yuh
Care for me, care for me!
I know you care for me!
There for me, there for me!
Said you'd be there for me!
Cry for me, cry for me!
You said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me!
Why won't you live for me?!
That's a real one, in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You rarely pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta be nice for what to these niggas
I understand, you gotta hunnid bands
You got it, baby, Benz
You got some bad friends
High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressing off no lover in the past tense
You already had then
Work at 8am, finish around five
Hoes talk down, you don't see them outside
They don't really be the same offline
You know dog days, you know hard times
Doing overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them muthafucking angles
With your phone out snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright
It's a short life, yuh
These hoes
Your boy
I may
Watch the breakdown
Care for me, care for me!
I know you care for me!
There for me, there for me!
Said you'd be there for me!
Cry for me, cry for me!
You said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me!
Why won't you live for me?!
Gotta make that jump
Gotta make that-
Gotta make that-
Gotta make that jump
Gotta make that-
Gotta make that-
Gotta make that jump
Gotta make that-
Gotta make that-
That's a real one, in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You rarely piping up on these niggas
You gotta be nice for what to these niggas
I understand
Care for me, care for me!
I know you care for me!
There for me, there for me!
Said you'd be there for me!
Cry for me, cry for me!
You said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me!
Why won't you live for me?!
Gotta hit the club like you hit them, hit them angles
It's a short life, yuh
Cry for me, cry for me!
You said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me!
Why won't you live for me?!

Quick to let a motherfuckin' TEC slam
We don't need to hear about a next man
Youts talk down, then they get ran
Left them, get dipped from the whole ends
If Gilla call shots, no questions
G-Way 'til I'm restin'
But we still got love for the West End
If it's a chit-chat ting, better talk nice
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice
Skull gets hot, then I'm not nice
You tryna date her and she been, let me walk twice
Now you man are on a diss ting
Just know man like Chubbs
He's a fixer if I ever gotta fix tings
Just know man like Fifth, he's a sicko
As you get tanned, he don't miss things
Just know man like me, I'm a Sixer
And I oversee the whole thing
Yeah, I pree the whole thing
Yeah, I pree the whole thing
Preme got the hurt tucked, can't see the whole thing

Man catch suckers, then we're touchin' somethin'
Man gets stuck in, yeah, we're stuck in somethin'
Man gets rappin' when we're suckin' somethin'
Man gets battered with the crutch or somethin'
Man bat bat it, then we buck or somethin'
If man child play it, then we Chucky somethin'
If man start throwin', then we're chuckin' somethin'
I'm on the best side, got the TEC lined
In the whip, on the left side, on a death ride
MAC-10 and the spesh flies, and the TEC slide
Nutty shit like somethin' just climbed out the X-Files
Textbook, like it's old school, like in textiles
Lightie, lookin' healthy and she gets smiles
Home time, grab a quick drink and she gets wild
Sexy, and I rate that and her sex style
Fuckin' somethin', yeah nigga, fuckin' somethin'
Back bent, pussy, I'll fuck her somethin'
Cognac, better grab a cup of somethin'
Glue pussy like a nigga stuck or somethin'
Stuck or somethin', like a nigga stuck or somethin'
So the monster is like a truck or somethin'
Spread the pussy out, I'm 'bout to butter somethin'
Man gone Hollywood, it's like I'm Buck or somethin'

First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply

Trust
Trust who?
Watchin' my back even when I'm in the booth
Oh, trust who?
Doin' my thing, but I'm down to come clean, not like you
I wanna make you feel the weight's off your shoulders too
I'll take it
Just tell me it can't be that crazy
And even if it is that crazy, baby
I'll take it
I want you, I know you're not an angel
Not you
Oh, just save it
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm wavy and I'm sayin' things
That I don't mean, but I do mean
And I don't want you to miss me
'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
And you're crying and you're sayin' things
That I do believe, but I don't even
Want you to get in my mind
I'm supposed to be in your mind (Oh woah)
For the first time in a long time
For the first time in a long
For the first time in the longest time
[Drake:]
First time in a long time
[Chris Brown:]
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply
[Drake, (Chris Brown), {Chris Brown & Drake}:]
Yeah (Now, oh, baby)
Ayy
{Hurtin' deeply inside}
Trust
Trust
Trust
Trust who?
[Drake (Chris Brown):]
Trust me and I can set you free
Left your man, came straight to me
You the real MVP, (my love)
Ride dirty like Pimp C
You a real ten-speed freak, shawty
You was everything a nigga need
You was everything to me, (my love)
Why you keep that little shit from me?
Left me down on bended knee
When I scooped you in the Maybach
(The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat)
Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
When you know that we was meant to be
Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? Love
I've given you enough time
[Drake (Chris Brown):]
(Hurtin' deeply inside)
Trust
Trust
Hurtin' deeply, deeply
[Drake:]
Thought I knew the real, then they flipped
How many times did I ask about this, on God?
Why you let me find out like this, on God?
Houston, we got a problem, my dawg
All my niggas love you, got us all involved
Ain't no goin' back to how we started off
No, no, no, no
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I love you so much
But I hate what you've done
I know from here things will never be the same
And things will probably never change
I know what we want
Isn't exactly what God had planne I guess all I can do is
Hope you can see the difference
And pray for the best
Please don't forget me...
I will soothe your pain
I will ease your strength
I should let you fall in love with
Someone else girl
I live in L.A
You in Chicago
You're not patient
I'm not patient
We shouldn't be together
I think we shouldn't be together
No more no (no more no)
Just think I'm where it all beginning
You're the envy of your prince
Plus you know you're not yourself any more
The miracle of change
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl
And I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry girl
(Yeah)
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying
Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear
Try to control us
You wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us
All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments
I mean women inspire me to great things
(Drake:?)
I need to grow some fucking confidence
And why you gotta say the last words
And if I tell you how I really felt
(There probably end up being another argument candy girl,
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)
Yeah
And that shit starts to get old
And I don't mean to say the most
But you know how they say you are who you hang with?
SO IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU HANG WITH HOES
Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear
You know how they say
If you love somebody
That don't love you back
Love them anyway
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet wait on me
Nah, should have known nah-nah-nah
Should have known nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Should have known nah-nah-nah
Should have known nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> We both wake up, staring at the sky
Don't remember how we got here but we don't wonder why
Right now we living life like there's no way we can die
But we bout to do our thing they couldn't stop us if they try
Keep the weapon for the haters if they try to blow our high
How the fuck would they stop us if we by each other's side
We were meant to be together we get inside
How the hell would they kill us when we're feeling so alive
Ooh girl I know you want a G
It's kinda hard not to notice me
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Baby I can give what you want and everything you need
Put us both in a position where we can both succeed
And if it takes a sacrifice I promise I will bleed
All the blessings that I get I promise you'll receive
fuck them other niggas all they do is deceive
Let me take away your pain, my job is to relieve
Ooh girl I know you want a G
It's kinda hard not to notice me
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already I'm feelin' throwed in this bitch
I'm so high even when I'm comin' down
Just met a girl, said she from the H-Town
I said my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
A cup inside a cup smokin' ghost face killah
Got these boppers goin' crazy
Nigga, I'm the man, I sent your girl message
Said I see you when I can
She send me one back but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussies only pussy and I get it when I need it and
I'm tellin' you when homies runnin' down in the winter
And I be riding rims with tires in it thinner
Air force stun fly charters over seas full of Don Perian
And the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens every time we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drink till that motherfucker gone
Than you go get undressed and we gon' get it on
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow so slow, so slow but I do it to her
Draped up and dripped out know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Three in the morning get it poppin' in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga stay G till the end, yeah
I swear like every time we find ourself in this situation
I just get that feeling like I mean Houston candy paint
Switching colors in the light, it's about like 11 p.m.
And you just roaming through the city bumpin' that screw
Big Mo, UGK, Lil Keke
It feel like everything just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it, baby

Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls
This 2010 ain't 1864
Yeah we come so far
So I drive around town hard top and its off
And my trop at the loft with my high brow Ah and my high yellow broad
And my dark skin sense and my best white mate say whats up to Chris
Hows that for a mix
Got a black president, got green presidents
Blue prints in my white iPod
Black diamonds in my Jesus piece, my God
We ain't tripping off that
This is a Benetton ad, nigga been up off that

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> You finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
You're ready for something new
I'm still where I was last year
Meanwhile we're talking it out
You keep leaving things at my house
Seems like you're wanting to stay
But you need to know.
I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a man, I'm just a guy
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
Now got a life, back where I stay
Still pay a car note for this girl, around my way
You got the game and the talk
Keep turnin' out how I thought
Kept my feelings on low, all alone
Intuition never ever wrong
So what the hell, mix some vodka with Italian
Carousel, hitting circles I'm a stallion
And I'm a real one nigga, I'm my own med
You looking so damn thirsty, let me throw it back
Baby we are on to something, maybe if we had the time
Used to give my love for nothing, trust me, I'll be alright
I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a girl, I'm on my grind
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
I got a life, back where I stay
At least you still my only guy around my way
I said Baby, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
Baby I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on a wave, I'm on wave
I said Baby, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
Baby I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on a wave, I'm on wave
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> The clock that you've been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands are safe
They're safe
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Ohhh, think about the last time I came through
Had some more that I give for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Ohhhh baby I just landed
Bout to get my bags and
All I need's an address and I'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Because I'm on my way
Won't hurt just some turbulence we're dropping
Dont be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
Ill keep you safe, so safe
Less than a minute take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Ohhh, think about the last time I came through

Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo
Nosey niggas is peakin' in my window
Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober
Its my time now so them you months over
Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing
I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than.
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show
[Chorus]
I think that you know as well as I know
Bitches checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
[repeat]
[Verse 2]
I can easily make'em admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often (?)
So they don't like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this aint Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-el (As in Samual Jackson)
I've been real though (?)
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a (?)

Tell them again, love go way back when
So I type je t'aime but don't press send
Send some threat to the pen...

 <SONGSTART> I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over
One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up
Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
And nobody's ever done it like I did it
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing?

Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

Only over my dead body...
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
And still, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got 10 years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
And still, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

 <SONGSTART> [Verse: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told you
I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one
[Verse: The Weeknd]
All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love
She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
Well baby girl, I'm zoning
Somebody should've told her
I popped one
Fuck it, I popped one
Oh girl, I'm on one
I popped one
Girl, I'm lying, I'm on a few
Don't you worry, this ain't new
Can we take this to your spot?
I'm on eviction number 2
Cause I popped one
Fuck it, cause I popped one
[Verse: Drake]
You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So, you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one
Oh,
[Verse: The Weeknd]
Do you know what's going on over here
[I do, I do, I do]
Have you even bothered to look?
[I did, I did, I did]
Well if you know, then let me know
We don't gotta be running in these circles, in these circles
No more
[Break]
Trust issues (x14)
[Verse: Drake]
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the mothafucking North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting court side
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make them like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you, in you
Woah, trust issues (x3)
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> It's yours
It's yours
Yours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is?
It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin', wake up with me this weekend, weekend
Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
It's yours
Own it own it own it own it own it own it own it own it
Own it own it own it own it own it own it own it I said

Niggas talk more than bitches these days
(Just let that shit sink in)
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours
You should be supportin', but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline
You should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all, I swear to God
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's your, it's yours, it's-it's always gonna be yours
Own it own it own it own it own it own it own it own it
Own it own it own it own it own it own it own it I said
Go own that shit
It's yours
It's yours, own it
Own it, own it

Yeah
Wheezy out of here
[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digital, the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, look up 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
$2,500 for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch, I'm the Baby
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed
Me and my dawgs goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand no whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed
Me and my dawgs going all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate

You say you want me, I don't ignore you
You said it first, but I meant it more girl
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
You got potential, I can't explain it
You're so persuasive, I made some changes
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
[Bridge]
Where were you this whole time?
Come and see me now, not another time
You should come see me on the regular
I don't know if we'll find a better time
Where were you this whole time?
Come and see me now, not another time
You should come see me on the regular
I don't know if we'll find a better time
[Chorus]
'Cause I've been sleepin' with a pistol in my bed
I'd rather have you here instead, I gotta get outta my own head
Don't let me down, come here right now (Yeah)
Don't let me down, come here right now
[Verse 2]
Grow up and face it, don't keep me waiting
You love me how you love me, then just say it
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Girl what's the hold up? Come take me over
You came the closest, we should be closer
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause I've been sleepin' with a pistol in my bed

Don't let me down, come here right now (Yeah)

Who do it like I do? You tellin' a lie fool
Leave the beat dead, all read like Piru
Been around the world, all girls like fly dudes
You a herb, get on her nerves like flies do
You need more girls, go call my manager
Two, three, four more, sure, we can handle ya
Gimme e'rythang I want, don't mess my order up
And her ass on point so my homie brought her up
Ma passed me the blunt, then I told her pour it up
In a flash we was gone, and you know I tore it up
Breast, ass, silicone, sex hot as Florida
South Beach, mouthpiece could swallow a Porterhouse
Yup, it get nasty, then I get gully
Grab the coochie, then the Gucci skully
A whole pack of rubbers, then I burned rubber
You cuddle undercovers, tellin' her you love her
When it come to verses, swear that I'm perfect
Murder in the first it's chllin in the hearses
Worthless, singing off key on purpose

Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me
They still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
Give a real nigga the number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot beat me I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like one-on-one
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themself
But they still got they eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, aye
Momma doesn't have to call work now, aye
I decide when I start work now, aye
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)

My section in the club, Remy, Rose

? girl gon' wild, pop a bottle
bow, bow, bow...
[T.I.]
Bring the 1738 Champagne the boss

pop a cork, dork

I ball just as hard tomorrow as the day before
I pop bottles but I don't pour
save the glass for guys, we ballin' on a budget
fuck it, let your glasses rise
I'm straight to the head with mine, why you acting surprised
ask any hoe who know me, all I do is smash and ride
buckets of bubbly, shake it up and let it splash in the eyes
no subtraction, only cash to divide
we gettin' money, bank roll, supersized
whether rain, sleet, sunny
let the good times roll and the bottles keep coming
[Chorus]
[Drake]
Yeah, okay, bring that shit to poppa
I heard you talk bout other niggas
them other nigga no matter
the tag team back bitch, boom shakalaka

and a fuji for my nigga cause the police probably watching
man, probation is a bitch but going back is not an option
we be sunning all these niggas, put there ass up for adoption
and we start with straight shots, that get the bottle poppin'
we be working all night, telethon shit
roll a super skinny once you?
oooh, thats that fire, that have you calm shit

[Chorus]
[T.I.]
I know the sucker wish the judge threw the book at me

look at you like " ahh who?"
bought every bottle at the bar

I take em all across your, I aint finna argue

triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
tell the bitch I take you places where your man can't go

Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic 'cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Have fans but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' around
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a hundred fifty thousand dollars for an after party
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fuck with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

 <SONGSTART> Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow"
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my JesÃºs
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said "Hov, there ain't many of us"
I told him less is more, nigga it's plenty of us
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake
Uh I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel
Yeah uh, look, fuck all that happy to be here shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil' bro me dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and I say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin' different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same, man, I'm doin' it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else more than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway 3 months later I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's something to do, yeah
I guess its just who I became dog
Nothing was the same dog
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow"
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my JesÃºs
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said "Hov, there ain't many of us"
I told him less is more, nigga it's plenty of us
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

 <SONGSTART> (feat. Drake)
Now when it come to making money I'm a printing press
When it come to being Trill I'm a litmus test
I run it like a fitness test
And when it come to making history I'm like (?) son
A million ways to die you already chose one
A million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning
We on the top now go back and tell the we winning
And while ya there let em know we did it just for them
I made them cough the cash up and left them just the phlegm
Is that the King of the trill go tell em yes it's him
And his testosterone is up who's got the oestrogen
I like your girl and I think she like me even more
I hit her with that heave and ho and them I'm leaving bro
The dirty South's finest and dirty south's behind us
Now thats a plus on the report card not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your lighters
You got a problem with us you know its just as hard to find us
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
They know I'm on a Port Arthur state of mind southern superstar status
I elevate the crime
My time is money so I put some money on my time
Lightening on the Breitling so exciting when you see that shine
We on that leather (?) before its never even thought of
I broke my bread and fed the team just like the Holy Father
I helped the blind to see and keep it G just like I oughta
The only thing thats left for us to do is walk on water
We playing all four quarters til the clock expire
So til I see the ref waving I will not retire
My flow is still official and I still got the fire
Can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch the wire
And in '0-10 we finna go in
So let the opposition know there is no win
And I am no friend so put your hand down
Tell em stand down before it's man down
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
I gotta hundred girls on each phone
Drissy Drake man, young sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Home sick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time everyday we switching zones
Drizzy Hendrix I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard n-gga I'm quoting more n-gga
Results are in I guess you should have voted more n-gga
Swimming in the money y'all just float ashore n-gga
Never drowning what the f-ck you think this boat is for n-gga
Yeah I'm quick to take an RnB diva out
I'll bring some friends she'll bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done I'll put some slippers on and see them out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just trying to keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler everyday I'm riding clean
Ohhh
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down.
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Yea, Drizzy baby
You already know who it is

O, I see you homie
I stay late tonight right?
You know what happen when I stay late
Yea, Boy wonder
I swear it's like this every single time
Toronto I got you

I'm a hard guy to get along with
Get on a song with
When shit be going right, well I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to
The artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it "playing checkers"
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money I'll be happy to connect ya
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the President
Someone cut the lights on! Where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you trying to zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers are liars and their women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
And he got it for me and I'm as happy can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off a rebound
Yea, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because the nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they trying to get their swagger right
Cause I dunn came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue?
Oops! I mean a red clue
Wayne's here, Soo-woo!
Bet he felt like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake I hate to see him so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on the Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burnin' like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And no the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth then pull the zipper down and see
No homo though
Yea, um, I'm going in!
Drizzy I got us, this is my promise
Ima bring the barrel to them bitches eyeliners
And what I make up, will fuck up your skin
I pick buck up and buck-buck then buck-buck again
I will butt-fuck your friend
Then suck up her twin
I put the buck-up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude
Always had a black tool
Even when I was at school
Cause bullies aren't bullet-proof
Red scarf, hoody too
Probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything as good as you no I do everything better
I get paid for everything for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone. Like a dog motherfucker I am going for your neck
In a sec, intercept
Bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yo I am heading to the buck like
Buck-Buck again. Might fly to L.A and just fuck Karrine
Nahh fuck Karrine! Lets get bucks again, and fuckin' spend
Them bucks and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you I'mma do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted
Bout to pop a lets get it
Lets get it motherfucker whatcha waitin on
It is bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm with it if money is the it you want me with
And I prolly just spit on the chick you won't be wit
And I hate a boney bitch only like em only thick
And I own hip-hop, if you don't spit I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like Drake Drizzy Rogers
Or Drizzy Drake Rogers I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game I'm too willing to play harder
So harder I go, there he go
They chant MVP when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jas what it do
The haters are there facing and their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told ya, I get paid by the letter like
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y
ZZ Top, yes we rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox

Then the heat I send burn skin

Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' with just me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And that is too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since take care, I've been caretakin'
At second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven
Yeah
I know

 <SONGSTART> [Trey Songz echoing]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement...
[VERSE 1]
Let me show you what it is,
I was birthed up top,
I was raised at the bottom of the map,
Where the girls all thick,
And the hottest nigga rap,
And if you lookin for the good and we got 'em,
In the trap like (ooh wee),
took 'em from white sneaks to (looeee),
This metaphor might sound a lil confusing but (ya'll already knoow if you know me),
I done come a long way from the days inn,
Another hotel that i stayed in,
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good,
And now we see it's sitting at amazing,
Girls trying to ho lobby us,
Hear 'em all screaming and it's prolly us,
But i can't blame females,
Females can't really ignore something this obvious,
What you really expect when i strut through town,
Two or three days and i'll shut you down,
Chillin with the homie trey songz,
You call him the prince,
He rep two up, two down,
Anyone i know get used to me,
I'm far the man that i used to be,
And i don't ever really kick game,
And i know you find it impressing when you're introduced to me,
Cause imma good dude, take pride in that,
Need good loving i'm providing that,
Understand that i'm worldwide,
You get it how you want it wherever you be residing at,
Cause i do things from the M town to the UK from Spain back out to Texas,
This album for my fans but yo this hook is for my exes.
[CHORUS]
This one is for you girl,
You know who you are girl,
You only show your face,
Cuz you know that Im a star girl,
But ur trynna make it,
Dont ever mistake it,
Girl my time is limited,
And I aint trynna waste it (all on you),
You had your chance now its gone (so long for you),
You had a man now you dont (now you dont),
Back to da basics,
I think i made it,
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl.
[VERSE 2]
Aint you ever seen a youngin so fly,
Lookin for something yo type,
I been left behind the love of my life,
Trying to find another one tonight,
And if its you baby,
Let yourself be seen (dont mind the skirts),
Dresses and jeans (i got the work,
Know what I mean,
And I'm flexing on my ex,
If you know what I mean,
[CHORUS]
This one is for you girl,
You know who you are girl,
You only show your face,
Cuz you know that Im a star girl,
But ur trynna make it,
Dont ever mistake it,

You had your chance now its gone (so long for you),

[VERSE 3]
Wit' dem otha dudes she get picked up, for some take out
Till dey slip up, and then dey break out
But it's anotha story ova here at Drakes house
Cuz I'm dripped up, and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin
looking for a woman that i should wife
Who got just a right amount of loyalty in her
But still anticipatin us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO, sunshine,
And that heat stroke, and them fur hoods, and that deep snow,
We have breakfast in da bedroom,
Or break bread downstairs in the basement,
Since Jay & Kelz aint doing they thang no more,
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement.
[CHORUS]
This one is for you girl,
You know who you are girl,
You only show your face,
Cuz you know that Im a star girl,
But ur trynna make it,
Dont ever mistake it,
Girl my time is limited,
And I aint trynna waste it (all on you),
You had your chance now its gone (so long for you),

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> My Mazeradi and Ferrari like to chill with my Mercedes
See my Bentley, what I got when my two Phantoms had a baby
I'm not crazy, why you lazy? I get so politely daisy
Fuck you, pussy nigga, pay me my Lambo do 'bout 280
I sellin', heard you tellin', thought you killin' while you stealin'
Thought you dealin' while you chillin', you ain't ballin' with a million
God made me super rich, the devil made you stupid, bitch
You could be just like me if you quit with all that stupid shit
Why you actin' hard now you must want go see God now?
The same niggas you were beefin' with are up in your yard now
If you bout to run dogg, I guess you better start now
Forgot to bring your gun so you got to use your heart now
It's hard to get rich but it ain't shit to go to hell
It's hard to sell dope but it ain't shit to go to jail
It's hard to keep it real but it ain't shit for you to tell
I smoked so much of this that I can't even hide the smell
So drop
Drop, drop, drop
Now drop
Drop, drop, drop
We marijuana farmers, all our rides look like Transformers
Tell the pretty girls to pull they titties out and dance for us
You don't need a Gym Class, crack like Slim Fast
Take a hit and loss a fuckin' hundred pounds quick fast
Snow cone with a chain on and deep off or chain off
My blunt goin' kick the game off, we never take the game off
Find a hater, sign a hater, let him see my elevator
Hundreds in my refrigerator, now they know we gettin' paper
Find a hater, sign a hater, let him see my elevator
Hundreds in my refrigerator, now they know we gettin' paper
Pullin' coupes and escalators, enemies on respirators
Million dollar generators, 90 fast investigators
For flashy cars, the prison bars, mnage trois
The playin' cards I swear it's hard, now drop
Now drop
Drop, drop, drop
Now drop
Drop, drop, drop
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> 1 - Drake]
Who else really try'na fuck with Hollywood Cole?
I'm with Marley Gee, bro
Flying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I want to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow
And uhhh
My real friends never hearin' from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sippin' so this shit is movin' kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only Heaven's right above it
We on
It's Young Money, motherfucker
If you ain't runnin' wit it, run from it, motherfucker,
All right
Now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this ditch, ya dig?
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first
Meet me on the fresh train
Yes, I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke till I got chest pains
And you nigga know I rep my game like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin' plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me TripleA, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin' where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killa, but don't push me
How do he say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg
Muhfuckin' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, n-now, c'mon, be my blood donor
Flow so nice, she ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big, and let the small fall under that
Damn, where you stumbled at?
From where they make gumbo at?
Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumpin' jack
You know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga, nothin' short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

And they never will
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel

Taking pictures of yourself

The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things he can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished

 <SONGSTART> [Intro]
Goddamn
For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look
[Verse 1]
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' onâcrushedâleaves
They turn theyâback on everything we built thenâthey must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home, the white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heat waves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shortie really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep, dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meeks like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurie to MacKenzie, when the city's empty
Yeah, early twenties but I want fifties, hunnids, not pennies
I need plenty, got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down and break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'
[Chorus]
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin', yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
[Verse 2]
Yeah, look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions, pyramid scheme just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, etcetera
Inspired by a few but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
Always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East attention
And out of Pine Hill funeral center
A spot we got no business enterin'
Back when Gil Scott was the apple of my afrocentric
Aight, I had to find a way to get someone's attention
[Chorus]
Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin', yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
[Outro]
Now we rollin'

 <SONGSTART> hey there material girl
The neighbors told me that you're moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure that's what you're doing now
are you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
the past what you carry in your purses
the gift in the curse when you going head first is
the ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
luggage all packed and to them I say
farewell to the pure, amen I pray
You wander the world
you seek what you've lost
you're waking up every day
the run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
you're leaving to chase your fame
the run away, the run away girl
so long
farewell
good bye
good day
be on
your way
run away girl
(x2)
Watching it all through the window
and wishing you could make is shatter now
now that you're here on the other side
are you sure it even matters
are you living the dream
are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems
do you strip do you model do you live in between
and look for the split second that you get on the screen like
you wander the world
you seek what you lost
you're waking up every day
to run away, run away girl
I turn and you're gone
you're leaving to chase your fame
you run away, run away girl
so long
farewell
good bye
good day
be on your way
run away girl

Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person, first thing they say is
"I know you need a break"
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose
I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to

2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, "Thanks for givin' to me," like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers; that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah, it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like the Carter, we into jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah, I love my fans
But I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God, point guard and the two guard
"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music"
So I woke up with my wood hard

And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to

My favorite gun was a SIG, 20 in the clip, head one
Growin' up, I was a runnin' back

I got shot, sweat started runnin'
That shit was red like Hunt (ketchup)
I'm kickin' pimpin' like I punt
But don't you think shit's sweet?
I'm talkin' sweet, thin meat
I'm talkin' suite like he sleep
We ain't doin' too much talkin'
I'm talmbout talkin' like a speech
Like the President, I kill and meet
I'm talkin' neat like freak
I'm talkin' neat like fleek
I'm talkin' neat like a geek (yeah)
You come with beef, I eat the beat
I'm talkin' B's, spellin' B
Double R, that's a Rolls, paint it yellow like it's dairy
I'm talkin' Rose like Derrick
I'm talkin' Rolls like a Bentley

Tryna score the bucket like a Chevy seat
Then I heard they been pullin' all week
I'ma use her name, like, "Who is he?"
You get it? I said I'ma use her name, like, "Who is he?"
Got some gold on, leprechaun sheets
Deep sleep short for deceased
Big bezel on the Patty
I'm talkin' PADIâI meant Patek
Don't try to take it, I got guns
I'm talkin' guns, not pellets
I watch the game from the floor (floor seats)
I'm talkin' wood, first mattress

I'm talkin' woods like them clowns (you get it?)
I got my mink off a monkey
I'm talkin' monkey like Jumanji

Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah, it's all in the wrist

Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'

But I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God, point guard and the two guard

 <SONGSTART> Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's
Not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)
Tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
(I believe in people like you)
So who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I think there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late, I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)
Tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing you just drunk, you just saying sh-t
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and sh-t
Oh, wait, no, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, yeah, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cuz man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes
And I'm just trying to correct it and I fall.
I swear I always fall for your type, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)

Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of c-notes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood and go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh
Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese
You don't want drama, capisce?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlemagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna' pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love

Say something, I'm giving up on you

 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio is in character
As if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go
So they stick around, kicking out feedback
And I entertain it is if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back
But, It's hard thinkin in polite flows/
When Stephano Polato suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight close
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now the shit just been lypo'd
Always said I'll say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera someone got to tape this
I make hits and like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles, Cabanas, or Atlanta South
Watch Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't want to feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonders where my mind is, account's in the minus
And yet I role around the fucking city like ya highness
Got niggaz reacting without a sinus
Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters trying to get me out to they club
And say I have fun, but I can't imagine how
Cause I just see my ex girl, standing with my next girl, standing with the girl that I'm fucking right now
And shit can get weird, unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks, and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul
And Silvia be telling Taz damn Drake fly
And he just be like silly motherfucker I know
That was your bad, how can you pass up on 'em
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne would probably put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em
Oh they did Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, before they told me to 'do me'
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me, would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could have fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the Two Three
Drug dealers live, vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So If you find a blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm getting better still
Little niggaz put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause it's Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got that making of a legend feel
Problem with these other niggaz they ain't never real
Yea, it's all I can say

But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, ah

Ah, young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
So I'm a spend another ten thousand for Dilla
Call me over-rated or created or too jaded
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, yup!
How did I end up right here with you
After all the things that I been through
Its been one of those days
You tryin' forget about
Take a shot and let it out
Let's get right
Now that I'm here baby
Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
Show me a good time
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
Show me a good
Show me a good
Show me a good time

 <SONGSTART> These girls ain't got nothing on you
Uhh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
All the girls they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
Its obvious you're pretty
Heard that your a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what your doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures
Shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it, hey oh
These girls aint got nothing on you,
Nothing on you
Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you aint
Girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you aint
That boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, everytime you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And put you in the louboutins
What you want
What you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggas
Just wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn't know what to do with it
(and together)
We shut it down down down
They know we shut it down down down
Your the baddest girl around, round round
They notice, they notice
TMZ, concrete loop
You shut that muthfucker down down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that muthafucker down down down
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut them down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves - the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin
And your cousin fine, but she don't have my heart beating in double time
You just shut it down, girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found The One?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around its obvious you shut it down
You shut that shit down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it, ohh
They notice, they notice
You looking good girl
Go go go get em girl,
Go go go hit em girl
Go go go go go go
You looking good girl
Go go go get em girl,
Go go go hit em girl
Go go go go go go
You shut it down
The way I'm feeling, the things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay
I know its getting late
But girl I don't want you to leave
You tell me you're just not the type
You wanna do this right
And I'm not tryin to say I don't believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed
And if you feel the same
Just wait and really make us better people
Take those fuckin heels off its worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fuckin dress off I swear you won't forget me
You'll be happy that you let me lay you down down down
Tryin to lay you down down down
You still the baddest girl around round round
They notice, they notice
Let me lay you down down down
Tryin to lay you down down down
You still the baddest girl around round round
They notice, they notice
You would shut it...

Side pieces
I know that you're watching this from home
I can't wait to see you on the road
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about
I tell her you're just a friend
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end
I'm asking would you be mine
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you
This goes out to all my side pieces
Side pieces, side pieces

You know that you'll never be the main one
City to city I see you wearing the same one
Side pieces, side pieces
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces Brian McKnight one time
[Brian McKnight]
This is dedicated to all the side pieces
I know you'll never be more
And you'll always be less
But there's courage in knowing that you're ok being second best
I already got a starter but I'm looking for the rest of my team
Side pieces in training go on and wave your hands for Drake and me
(Don't be embarrassed)
Side pieces where you at
(Probably in the top balcony)
I know you're not down here in front of us you got to be way back in the back
(They can't even see us)
Side pieces go on and be, side pieces ya
Side pieces

 <SONGSTART> Yeah
According to my, as you beg I testified it
I been alone, girl, you finally got me on my own
I know and I miss you
Know how to treat you, but it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news, like "dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful
We gotta listen to the old Kelly
You slipped out of feelin' already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you
Girl, I know you
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you were special
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a little sexual, with you
Because I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wavecap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped up if you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you were special
Yeah, you know already
Six months since I've been back in the Six
I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, baby
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe
