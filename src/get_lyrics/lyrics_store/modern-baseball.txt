 <SONGSTART> Are you hearing me?
Are you embracing facts?
Say things you understand
That way you're catching my drift
Will you stay with me?
Will you sleep here tonight?
Just don't walk away
When I say "crush"
Are you here with me?
Or are you out in Space?
Orbiting
Think you know everything you got coming?
Will you stay with me?
Please don't walk away
Can't wrap my head around this
I don't wanna understand
You and I have come such a long way, for us to start again
You and I have come such a long way, for us to start again
You and I have come such a long way, for us to start again
You and I have come such a long way, for us to start again
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> The first time I saw you was in your apartment
I had followed my friends single-file through the darkness
I looked your direction for excessive inspection
And I could not muster the courage to say a single word
For a while we were playing this game that your friends bought
But everyone cheated and no one could spell
You didn't say much of anything
I must have come off annoying, cause you went to bed
I walk home with my eyes low
Dreaming up conversations we'll have tomorrow
Your loose ends, my new friends
All the classes in high school we fell asleep in
But now I can hardly close my eyes
The next time I saw you was in your apartment
Oh, why do I keep ending up here on starlit evenings?
I should be home sleeping
But this time you sat next to me on the couch
(dude, nice!)
I stare out the window
Hands glued tight and sore
Praying to God-knows-what
That you would sever what's stuck
With something shiny from the kitchen drawer
I walk home with my eyes low
Dreaming up conversations we'll have tomorrow
Your loose ends, my new friends
All the classes in high school we fell asleep in
But now I can hardly close my eyes
I was wondering if, maybe, you wanted to hang out tonight
We could make dinner or something
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Did you ever love me
Biopsy from the origin of sound
Confirms you're speaking truthfully
Concludes everything I thought about
Is this past or present
I can't seem to make it all out
What truths but shall I find in the heat of the moment
Betrayal, what have I done now
You think we can make it
Well I wish I felt the same way I did then
Homesick, just waiting
To return to you and your hand
Is this past or present
I can't seem to make it all out
What truths but shall I find in the heat of the moment
Betrayal, what have I done now
it's not like me to forgive and move on
oh it's
Looking back on my mistakes saying others
Too destined to see where I went wrong
well
You say this is forever
You told me this is forever
Say this is forever
Tell me this is forever
Say this is forever
Tell me this is forever
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I'm the best friend you have in this town, or at least you tell me so
I'm the only one you talk to day and night
But your days and nights must be slow, your days and nights must be slow
I'm the best friend you have in this town, or at least you tell me that
I must be the under-the-carpet, dirty little secret
You wish you never had, you wish you never had.
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I can't help thinking about you this whole ride home
From Alberta, Portland to wherever I'll soon unfold
Into oblivion or somewhere between here and fact
Forever waiting for you...
Ever-aching cause I'm
Longing for when I'll be coming back to you.
Hopeless, I'm fading
It's the same damn thing every night
Planning our future without you, without me at times
But hey I... digress
What I was saying before is more important
I'm longing for when I'll be coming back to you
Why does it take two thousand miles for me to say
"I love you"
Burn Out by day, Lover by night
I'm not the same as I was but that's cool, whatever
Burned out by days without you
I'm lost, forlorn I can't do this alone
Alone, I feel safe
Still with you I'm safe, intact and hopeful
We'll make it together
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Home alone on friday night
No better time for exercise
And wishing you were still my girlfriend
Sweeping floors and folding napkins
Praying something cool might happen
The sun explodes, we die
The world ends
Talking to my friends about stuff
Nasty beer and plastic handcuffs
Back when them and you and me
Would share our space in harmony
Oh, why did I do that?
Why does everything collapse?
Even when it's glued together
Hey, why did I do that?
I make everything collapse
Even when it's glued together
Questioning my awkward footing
Mixing bitter pills with chocolate pudding
Hiding gifted fixtures
Trying to not say words out loud
Wondering if I'm talking too loud
My eyes burning holes in your old pictures
Oh, why did I do that?
Why does everything collapse?
Even when it's glued together
Hey, why did I do that?
I make everything collapse
Even when it's glued together
Fuck you why did I do that?
It's your fault I can't relax
But nothing's changing while I'm sitting here
With both hands glued together
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Though you might think you're cute
It's not so giggly, when you prance around acting like you're a somebody
Growing up in this good for nothing town
Saying "I'm gonna make, I'll get out"
Well good luck, when all you'll ever be
Is just a dreamer, stop convincing me
Otherwise, with actions you hold with dignity
Like dropping out of college cause its quote unquote
Getting the best of me
Free from the life that will be our demise
Like searching around for some real occupation cause you say well
"I've got connections man"
I'll search long, I'll search long and hard for you
But you'll just be at home
Face -First in a bowl and I'll say
"Well, where did he go?"
Working back-room at Staples just for the extra money
Cause you already live off your parents and your friends weed
Living each day by some new decree
"Well if I just wait around things will surely come to me!"
Might as well just throw away your dreams and aspirations
Cause truth be told they wont just fall in your lap
Now I'm not saying I want you out of my life
But I'll go grab your coat and hat
Free from the life that will be our demise
Like searching around for some real occupation cause you say well
"I've got connections man"
I'll search long, I'll search long and hard for you
But you'll just be at home
Face -First in a bowl and I'll say
"Well, where did he go?"
I've been tryna think of ways to say this without spraying it
But I can't cause I'm up in your face
Talking to you
Searching around for answers and clues
Of why you have nothing to do
Free from the life that will be our demise
Like searching around for some real occupation cause you say well
"I've got connections man"
I'll search long, I'll search long and hard for you
But you'll just be at home
Face -First in a bowl and I'll say
"Well, where did he go?"
Let the shotgun shells of your parents graduating class, light up your eyes
(Free from the life that will be our demise
Like searching around for some real occupation cause you say well
"I've got connections man"
I'll search long, I'll search long and hard for you
But you'll just be at home
Face -First in a bowl and I'll say
"Well, where did he go?")
Now don't call me cute
And don't call me giggly
Cause I'm getting the f**k outta here, you'll all see
I'm actually running around chasing my dreams
You won't say "Where did he go?" about me
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I'm pretty good at feeling sorry for myself
Making up fake lives but nothing like, tangible
Daydreaming while watching the TV
Intricate combos by myself to fall asleep
But alas, none of them come true
No car accidents, plane crashing
No six o'clock news
Just me and my too-far-away TV
(Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Bob, can you hear me?
Sorry, but it looks like we lost reception)
Whoa, tragedy's got my heart a-beatin'
Whoa, rethinking all my days
Whoa, tragedy's got my heart a-screamin'
Take them away, oh just take them away today
Wait a minute, cause I've been living
More like a fucking king without you
And I've been spending all your past feelings
On a bunch of shit that I won't use
Whoa, tragedy's got my heart a-beatin'
Whoa, rethinking all my days
Whoa, tragedy's got my heart a-screamin'
Take them away, oh just take them away today
Whoa, tragedy's got my heart a-beatin'
Whoa, rethinking all my days
Whoa, tragedy's got my heart a-screamin'
Take them away, oh just take them away today
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> It's not just what you say
Or how you come so far
The words that you repeat
In times you're twice apart
That smug look on your face
When you have something to hide
Well at least that's what I think
Maybe I'm out of touch
You tell me if I'm wrong
But you know I'm right
Spit far spit fast I'm needing
I'm sure this won't linger
Longer than it has to
Get out of my way stead fast I'm leaving
I'm a certain kind of way
I'm a certain kind of way, tonight
I know it can't be in my head
It must be what of you
Who keep pulling me aside
To chit chat about me
Who I am
What the deal is with who I was once
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> You hold my hand
You hold your liquor
Projection screen
Hot scene sticks flicker
You gave me a tiny taste
Of your truth
I was starved and you were full
I drove back home
When you got sicker
Disputing claims that you still held the TV clicker
And his face was flushed still in my mind
The way you asked if she was fine
oooooooooo
You need to hide
It's in your framework
Look me in the eyes and act like I don't know how shame works
Your compass spins in reverse
The trees do timelapse speak of
The sky is lost behind a sea of rain
She's acting like she knows what's up
She's trip tripping that devotion stuff
Breaking record Bren won't pop
She said she's sipping from the holy cup
Waking up
Everyday is all about doing things you don't want to do
But you're rewarded
You get to wake up
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I hate worrying about the future
Cause all my current problems are based around the past
And I hate when you call me late at night
Just to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about
But it's alright
And I'm okay
I won't need your help, anyway
Ah, well
I hate having to think about my future
When all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me
I'm so tired
Or maybe just bored
I can't really tell the difference whenever I'm talking to you
And I know that
You just adore
Starting off with me, that way that there's no way that I'll assume
That you're wasting
All of my time
To vent about your problems like how your Instagram stopped working
And how your friends
Bailed on you
But it was funny cause it was the day you were supposed to hang with me
(Yeah... about that...)
I'm guilty as charged for leading you on
A lie that I know is easy to see
But it's crucial to blot out any
Signs that I might have feelings
This way you don't ask me how am I
This way you won't force me to proceed
With actually having to tell you my worries
With actually having you give a damn about me
You giving a damn about
I hate worrying about the future
Cause all my fucking problems are based around the past
And I hate when you call me late at night
Just to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about
But it's alright
And I'm okay
I won't need your help anyway
Ah, well
I hate having to think about my future
When all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> What do you give someone who's already got one of everything you thought would be the perfect accoutrement to their unnerving temperament?
Attention.
What could a lowly peasant, being like myself, offer a perfect, pleasant savior of humanity, redeemer of us sickly, sitting hillbillies?
Attention.
Just one more resounding stab at all the others
You've almost blown your cover,
But your traps don't stick
One more bottle should do the trick
Discretely cleansing the remnants of every disdainful quip
We've found no escape route,
But I know you well enough to hate you now
It's too bad you haven't figured that out
What do you call someone who calls you out on DIY ethics you don't embody, as he drains his dad and mommy's monthly data plan?
An asshole
With an iPhone.
I'll admit I'm in the same boat:
Caught between my adolescent safety net
And where the world wants me to be
But I never use that as an excuse
To treat my friends
The way that you treat me
Just one more distorted and sad attempt at humor
From the jagged, bleeding tumor in our throat
Malignance at best
And quick to address yourself as anything other than what we've learned to expect.
The patron saints of Good God Damn.
I'll kick myself to sleep before I shake your grimy, dirty, crusted, arrogant hand.
So please leave my house.
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Take the train to Frankford
I won't answer when they call
I guess that's just my gift to myself
Drank a lot and danced to The Cure
Holding on for dear life
To the frayed edge of a feeling we misplaced years ago
And knowing we should really get back home
Made mistakes
The plants died young, like all good things
But I wish my small self had known
How much water to use
Still some nights I find
The ideas that bring me rest
Are the ones that used to prod and pester and keep me up
Swinging open doors I swore I'd shut
Pouring pewter
Amassing coins to displace debt to you
My straight-line shooter
Let me learn here
I am in pursuit of all I can undo
Entertain the cancer
We all answer upwards either way
The waiting game is tied again
Backs of hands and phrases
Misplaced gazes
Things we still deny to selves and hesitate to talk about
A call from high school two drinks in
I smiled but you could not see
Your tin can cell receiver Hummed its New York static song
The lever pulled and all at once
The floor was false
The center seam divided
Lace and well-pressed cotton
Found the flood we'd since forgotten
We still leave our shoes at the door
Before we wring out our wet clothes
Across your floor and future
Stitch the gaps that destiny assumed
With floral sutures
Are you hiding or have I abandoned you?
Let me learn here
I am in pursuit
Of all I can undo
Of all I can undo
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> He's been haunting my dreams at night
I've been bleeding from tripping in the dark
Trying to turn on the light
Trying to turn on the light
He's been haunting my dreams alright
I been hollering at him in the dark
Trying to find the right switch
Yeah my third wish
Is always been three more
But this time my Holy Ghost
Is hovering over me
And I am passed out on the floor
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Blind of our futures
Destined to shoes we know won't fit
Riding high amongst the ignorance
I'm guessing for the bliss
Counting down the days and hours till we meet again
I'll scream through all these trees
This voice I'll project
If you love don't let it go from
We will be the first to wonder
Where life meets living
I'll wish full forever, I've been wishful all along
And we can plot and plan, make our mends
But what we got, it will never be gone
Rip through me, rip through my words
Pour me out, push me forwards
Take all that I got to give, cause these times were made for ending
(though I wish they weren't)
I'll love you forever, Hell I've loved you all along
And since screams and shouts
Won't stretch these clocks
Let's live our time by
"Oh just one more song"
Late at night you'll be tucked up
I'll be cold but you'll soon suck up
All that I've got to give
And to be honest I'm quite okay with it
If you love don't let it go from
We will be the first to wonder
Where life meets living
(your hands, hold tight, don't spend all of your time tryna' remember living)
We don't need a place and time, no
We got all the places and times we need,
Or so we think
We don't need a place and time, no
We got all the places and times we need,
Or so we think, lets just think
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> It's not fair.
All is wrong, again.
I'm not right; content with regret.
And it's so late.
And I'm so tired, again.
Yet, wide awake.
Forget what you said...
Catch me wasting away, or whatever.
Spend all my time, confined to home.
Forget what you said, why bother?
I'll never forget you said...
This Is all so surreal.
What is this place?
So many mirrored faces, but not a single name.
And "it's alright", I sing it everyday; one thousand times, one thousand ways.
Catch me wasting away, or whatever.
Spend all my time, confined to home.
Forget what you said, why bother?
I'll never forget you said. "
You'll be face to face with forever, if you spend all your time alone.
Do you remember what you said when we met?
I'll never forget you said." You and I were made to feel this way, when worlds collide will you be there with me?
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I'm a waste of time and space
Drifting through my selfish ways
I don't know how I got here
Travel light endlessly
Distort all reality
I can't say how I got here
I'm a waste of time and space
Meandering unwanted days
I don't know how I got here
Entering a well known phase
I scream get lost, I hate everything
I can't say how I got here
Still, I can feel the need to change me from the inside
But I can't let anyone know just yet
If it's all the same it's time to confront this face to face
I'll be with you the whole way
It'll take time, that's fact
I'm not just another face, I'm not just another name
Even if you can't see it now
We're proud of; what is to come, and you
I'm a waste of time and space
Slipping past with getaways
I've planned for days, for weeks, for years
I'm a waste of rock and dirt
Grass and ground
And all the earth around me
Around you
Still, I can feel the need to change me from the inside
But I can't let anyone know just yet
If it's all the same it's time to confront this face to face
I'll be with you the whole way
It'll take time, that's fact
I'm not just another face, I'm not just another name
Even if you can't see it now
We're proud of; what is to come, and you
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Pulled over at midday
The joker's still wet behind the ears
He hands off a novel of novice citations
Outside the service station
The glue sets beneath our heels
My baby's in Massachusetts
And all this booze is useless
Sunset sing my scratched out sighing soul to sleep
And the cashier here is ruthless
Jeanette, I wrote your name down
But I'd hate that job as much as you do
If I was stuck between Barton and Bighamton too
Days like this I miss listening to records
Making coffee together, snow globes and jersey sheets
I tried sleeping in our bed without you last night
But that didn't work at all because I couldn't sleep
Sometimes I wish it was still last summer
And you still lived in South Philly
And I wasn't playing a show in Nebraska
Or Austin, Texas
Asking the kids what they ate for breakfast
But here I am, Valero bathroom
Who's paid to keep these things cliche?
Bury me beneath New York State
Because it's the only place where I feel dead
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> My love, my love is more than enough
To fight off any fightings of
Your lust for him, my loathing spits or that little pity party face
You make when you're not up to par for one of our arguments
My love, my love is more than enough
To fend off those monsters from
Your childhood, our kids better not live the same
I'm not afraid to say how I feel, even if it's hate
We are more than
Just another
Movie moment
I'm not gonna wait for rain for me to kiss you
My love, my is more than just fun
Not just late night sex
And trust me two is not as bad as one
My love, my love is partially serious
I can't wait to get done work to start arguing with you
My love, my love is bursting straight through my guts
I've crawling on your floor pleading "I haven't had enough"
My love, my love is cunning yet tough
Some compare it to a fire, but comparing's not us
We are more than
Just another
Movie moment
I'm not gonna wait for rain for me to kiss you
My love, my love is more than enough
I'm gonna stay here forever and f**king adore you
My love, my love is more than just love
It's figuring everything out when we have no clue, My Love
We are more than
Just another
Movie moment
I'm not gonna wait for rain for me to kiss you
I'm not gonna wait for rain for me to kiss you, My Love
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Holt's above my hideout
I dug this hole beneath the floorboards
Buzzing bad and locked in
Try to not recall
Counting numbered days
From the wheel we cried to clutch
Looking for some inspired land
But all I found were empty cans and cigarette butts
Lining dirty parking lots in Ottawa
(Glazed eyes, trying to rub away at the sketches of the...)
Daytime
When every second of sun's the same
What's the point of staying awake?
Your hands are out and I see
You're asking me for a vowel but I am weak and I am stubborn
So I'll say "This is all I have right now"
But I want to make something good
I want to make something better
Something that cannot leave the ground
Unless we lift it up together
Where I want to be still seems a thousand miles away
But pretending we feel safe right here gets harder every day
It's a note to self mislaid
You ate the words you always used to say
There will be no more fucking around today
Drunk and worthless, spewing bullshit all across the stage
Wake up and we find new hiding places
Trying desperately to escape
The glare from our stupid, spineless
(I don't believe you, you're all the same)
Words just whining, every fucking day
What do I really want to say?
Where I want to be still seems a thousand miles away
But pretending we feel safe right here gets harder every day
It's a note to self mislaid
You ate the words you always used to say
There will be no more fucking around today

 <SONGSTART> Dear "long, dark hair",
I write cause I know you'll forget
You could be sea-green in a waste basket tomorrow
No repulsions for
My premature indulgences
If you cant recall a word I said
Not like those cheek bones,
That crooked nose
No, those fellas stick around too long
Perpetuate in every pathetic word
That I askew into song
She was my trophy shelf of slip-ups
My untamed, hormonal, acne shit show
On late night rotation for months on end
A brick-boot swimming lesson
In the deep end of my adolescence
Scrawling notes on the backs of my hands
But I'll start fresh with you
Extracting the rusted attachments
Keeping the die-hard nuts, bolts and screws
We'll go from square one with the wit of an old pro
And you can fill in the gaps with whatever you know
My "long, dark hair"
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> The fossils of my footsteps will be unearthed at a far off date, unknown
Impressed in concrete from walking home alone after walking you home
And the mops of greasy hair will romanticize my despair
But they wont know that I didn't care
I like the silence, I like the empty streets
Crawl down on my hands and knees in a heartbeat if I had to
I owe 'em that at the very least
The map had faded out but I could have sworn I noted every stride
I guess the rain hit before the ink had dried
And where i thought id be was not what I perceived
Assessing the progress from beneath your sheets
That's why I need the silence, I need the empty streets
Just as bad as they don't need me
Its a sick, sad, sham of a marriage
But its all there is, its all I need
I can be everything you need if you make me
I can be every crack in your concrete if you let me off easy
I can be easily deceived if you want that
But you are the ember of my heart, whether you like that or not
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> I'm just not the same
And I'm never gonna be again
Pissing contest in the parking lot
I wonder if I'll win
I'll just point and blame
To the bottles under the third bench.
It's not hard to hoax a smile
In front of your friends.
I spend a lot of time reading up on things I do
I spend that other time with you
I'll just moan and complain
About how I'm over "all this"
Two short of a Joinerbomb
They'll grin and gossip.
I spend a lot of time reading up on things I do
The quarrels with myself are turning into feuds
Investigate your tone of voice
For subtle clues
Are you the one who changed me?
Am I the one who changed you?
"You're just not the same as when we met
I don't know you anymore
Can you take me back to the time when
Your clothes took up my drawers?
Of all the horrid things
Your stupid smile
I saw your face when I said
"Why'd you have to: go and change
Ruin what we made, destroy everything."
I'm just not the same
I'm just not the same
I'm just not the same
I'm just not the same
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Is he here? Are you making out?
I can hear you guys on the couch
Shut up, make out, do something already, I'm waiting.
After reading that text from your friend, I start losing all of my confidence
Oh, I'll stay tired, I know soon I'll be bailing
Then you, you ask if I've gotta leave and I wish that I could say no
My head is on the verge of exploding
No amount of aspirin of pizza could help this from hurting
And now I'm turning to you, scared shitless, hoping this song goes well
Can we hide, like, the fact that my mouth smells like coffee and garlic
The five cups I had this morning are getting to me
I gotta go, I've got like the worst fucking spins
Then you, you ask if I've gotta leave and I wish that I could say no
But we're so caught up in the moment
And I just need a second to catch my goddamn breath
Fuck it
To hell with the spins, I'm staying
There's no good reason why I should leave your bed tomorrow
We can watch planet earth and brain storm tattoos
To hell with class I'm skipping
Lets order food and sleep in
I've got so much to do
But it's ok cause whatever, forever
To hell with the spins I'm staying
There's no good reason why I should leave your bed tomorrow
We can watch planet earth and brain storm tattoos
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> You're a love searching urchin, worst part you're not one of a kind
You're the beat of my heart when I'm up late at night
You're the "baby why haven't we kissed yet"
You are, all I see is a sunset and your silhouette
You're just another girl and I'm just another boy
I'll try to make you fall for me but all you'll say is
"Don't enjoy our time together because it's short"
I'm a love searching urchin, worst part I'm not one of kind
I am, most likely to get lost in those eyes
Baby, I'll just g-g-give it all
If you just stay monogamous
We are love searching urchins, worst part we're not one of a kind
We are, stuck in lust not each others minds
We are, way too young for this
You know you're right fuck it let's just give in
You're just another girl and I'm just another boy
I'll try to make you fall for me but all you'll say is
"Don't enjoy our time together because it's short"
You're just another girl and I'm just another boy
You'll bash your lips against mine and all I'll say is
"Don't enjoy our time together because it's short"
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> There's a tombstone in the brush with your name on the front
But I had no bucks to get "Here lies They-Ran-Outta-Luck"
On the back of it
Sharp as a tack, but in the sense that you're not smart, just a prick
In my finger or my toe
Ripping staggered holes all the way to my chest
All the way to my chest
But every tremble in your voice still echoes in my ears
One good night of sleep per year
There's a tombstone in the brush with my name on the front
But I had no bucks to get "Here lies He-Ran-Outta-Luck"
On the back of it
Sharp as a tack, but in the sense that I'm not smart, just a prick
In the fingers and the toes of all of those who show interest in me
And from where I'm standing
It looks like I'm way long overdue
I know what you meant when you said "fuck you"
Breaking up never felt so cruel
And now I'm tired
And now I'm dead to me
Can we act like we never broke each others' hearts?
At least mine, I don't know how you felt from the start
Oh, that's vile, oh, I'm cruel, oh it's god damn mean
I sure as hell know one thing
You sure ain't dead to me
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Didn't watch your ex's set
I just left and thought about you
Like when your teeth graze those lips; when you begin to smile
Later, you took my hand, you led us to the doorway
But you let go of me once you saw all your friends
And I've known you forever, at least that's what I tell Jake
When I'm too drunk to walk home, when your brother's away
You suggested I write a song about the first time we met
But I can't seem to remember where or when
Couldn't watch your ex's set
Instead, I wrote this song about you
Thought, 'Would you show your kids if you found the time was right?'
You'd tell them where and when
You never I thought I'd leave the east coast
We were young and full of sin, and I too dumb to understand
Yet, I've loved you forever, at least that's what I tell Holt
When I'm too drunk to lie, to drugged to be alone
You suggested I write a song about the first time we met
But I don't want to remember there or then
So, is this the you wanted? Is it stuck inside your head?
Can you sing it with your friends, or alone?
So, am I what you needed?
Said you loved me to my face, grin and gossip, walk away,
And then go:
'So, is this the you wanted?'
Sing about me to my friends, while you're just stuck inside your head,
All alone
Oh, you were all I needed
Said I loved you to your face, but you just laughed and walked away
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Hey you, that's no way out.
You can't find help in a bottle or a cut.
They'll choose the wrong way to remember you.
They'll find the wrong words to say...
Hey man, whatcha thinking about?
Not to be blunt, but haven't heard from you in days.
Are you okay?
You can talk to me.
Do you have anything to say?
It's fun to be all talk, but I won't be here forever.
Rough time to be a lost soul, I'm sure, but we feel the same.
Death won't bring friends and flowers to your grave.
You don't know how to behave, when we're so far.
Hey man, whatcha up to now?
That's so typical Bren, all you sing about is girls.
Take a stand man, you can find voice that's not haunted by old flings.
Hey kid, think you got a sec?
I can call you.
I just wanted to check in.
It's been a lifetime since we spoke last, I have a thousand things to say...
It's fun to be all talk, but I won't be here forever.
Rough time to be a lost soul, I'm sure, but we feel the same.
Death won't bring friends and flowers to your grave.
You don't know how to behave, when we're so far.
Let's go we can't lose another day in your old room.
Caught you wasting away on accolades for songs you wrote, paralyzed by change, but scared to death that you might stay the same.
Hey man, whatcha thinking about?
Not to be blunt, but haven't heard from you in days.
Are you okay?
You can talk to me.
Do you have anything to say?
It's fun to be all talk, but I won't be here forever.
Rough time to be a lost soul, I'm sure, but we feel the same.
Death won't bring friends and flowers to your grave.
You don't know how to behave, when we're so far.

 <SONGSTART> Wait a minute cause I've been living more like a piece of shit without you
and I've been spending all your past killings trying to drink my way out of this groove
Wait a minute cause I've been living more like a piece of shit without you
and I've been spending all your past killings trying to drink my way out of this groove
Wait a minute cause I've been living more like a piece of shit without you
and I've been spending all your past killings trying to drink my way out of this groove
Wait a minute cause I've been living more like a piece of shit without you
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Trying hard not to look like I'm trying that hard
Failing miserably at everything including that
Making plans in my head right before I go to sleep
Trying to think of who could make a better me than me
Maybe I'll shoot him an email,
Maybe he'll give it a go
Then I'll be free to just evaporate, disperse or implode
Picking at holes in my jeans
There's so much god in my gene pool
Not feeling lonely, I just like being alone
I've called a through if already but no one knows why
One girl, one man, two pay checks are more than I can handle
Mathematically, and I can't be more than one end of a candle
Bottom of a ninth, can't find my socks
Lord knows I'm stuck between two good things
But I just want to get out
And mom knows i should've been home an hour ago
But I'm still outside not doing anything wrong
Just walking in circles, and playing high school songs in my head
Because it's better than lying awake
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> Find it hard to believe tonight
In a curiously well-kept house built before I was born
This year we're gonna stamp out the sorry feeling
Rain on summer vacation
Five blocks from Tasker-Morris station
Fuck the ride home
If I can't find two bills to rub together before
Midnight rolls around
I thought you heard me
Sing your spirit sound
You turned in early
Left the TV flickering
It staged
Romance across your face
Said goodbye from the front porch
I always wonder if you're smiling at us or if you're looking away
I'd ask but either way I'd feel sorry for ya'
Locked your love in a screenshot
They don't work that way
But I'd been wishing I could say that I don't
The selfish side likes to think my execution's more
of an honest one
These artists all cut clock with underscored
Conviction
Blacked out friction
Flies me back to Baltimore
To wait for you
And I'm stuck here too
Until midnight rolls around
I thought you heard me
Sing your spirit sound
You turned in early
Left the TV flickering
It staged
Romance across your face
 <SONGEND>

 <SONGSTART> When I was younger
I thought of caring
As a reason for some to praise me, in envy
"So humble and kind"
"No better person"
Now that I'm older I've seen what I've been
Ruthless, ungrateful, always trying to turn up tracks
Be it about me or you
Seeking out the faithful in me
With tricks of trust and gluttony
I won't wait for anyone anymore
When I was younger I thought of deep space
Pick me up swiftly, carry me away
Drop me off willing--light years lone gone
Never again seeing those who I loved
It's not about me this time, there I go lying again
Please save my soul
I don't know what I'm doing anymore
Seeking out the faithful in me with singles and a pen
Is it possible I'm overthinking this
It's not what I'm not it's what I believe in
It's not what I've got, it's my peace of mind
Too early to see if I'm still in the past
Too hopeful to be wasted time
It's not what I'm not it's what I believe in
It's not what I've got, it's my peace of mind
Too early to see if I'll be
Seeking out the fraud in me
With compassion and honesty, I'll wait....
 <SONGEND> 

 <SONGSTART> It's been a day or years of me thinkin' 'bout you everyday
Sometimes for hours, sometimes in passing
Saw you from the bottom of the staircase
Stood out for hours as you complained
About how you haven't seen your friends yet
That you're too drunk to stand and
You not knowing if you can love him forever
Bullshit you fucking miss me
There I said it I guess I'll talk to you in a few months
Sitting drunk on the sidewalk
I guess I'll get up
I guess I'll go for a walk
Brushed my shoes against the pavement
I swear this has gotta be the hundredth
Time I thought of you tonight
You weren't the only one
who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake
Wide awake
I never thought that I
Oh I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go
Let you walk away
Where I let you walk away
Once you call
You crook, called you a bandit
There ain't no other good damn reason why
Why I would even go missing
For so many months so I was wishing that you
That you would stop pretending
Remember all those countless nights
When I told you I loved you
And you'd never forget it
Oh just forget it
You weren't the only one
who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake
Wide awake
I never thought that I
Oh I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go
Let you walk away
Where I let you walk away
You weren't the only one
who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake
Wide awake
I never thought that I
Oh I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go
Let you walk away
Go ahead and walk away
Send "Your Graduation" Ringtone
